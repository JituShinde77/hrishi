You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Wow
They do to!
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Great
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
What do you think?
What's normal?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Like you care.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
You did what?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
You set me up.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Daddy, I --
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Get out!
You know French?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Forget it.
William didn't even go to high school
Does it matter?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
That's what you want, isn't it?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Do what?
Start a band?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No.
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Say it
What?
What's to discuss?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
What just happened?
Absolutely not.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
How far from here?
What does he say?
I'm not bargaining!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
All I have to do is call the guards.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Now I become custody of police department?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
No, what is it?
This isn't homicide school.
I'll let you know what happens.
I'm on duty.
My point exactly.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
So what's unique?
Ready?
Okay.  You ready?
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
This all you want?
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that fucking thing off!
What is it?
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Did you hurt her?
Robert...?
That's what it looks like to me.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Get outta here!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
CONTINUED
Right. Just a sec.
It's possible.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
Yes, I thought so.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Good morning. How's it going?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
What is it, Hal?
Well, don't worry about it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
That's true
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Yeah?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Where's ganz?
Yeah?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
What do you think?
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Not likely, convict.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Do I get to kiss her too?
Partnership?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Yeah...
Which one pulled the trigger?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Great place for lunch.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hard man to live with.
Stall.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
Let her go.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
No thank you.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
We have to save the world.
Of course.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Where's Leeloo?
I was talking to the cat.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
30 seconds...
...Hi.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
What did you say? What did you do?
I thought you were divorced.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Where you going?
You're nothing but a... a...
...Like love...
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Perfect, Mr. President.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
...Not far, now.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Don't...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
I'll consider it.
We can do that.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What do you want?
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
You enjoy it?
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Keep moving.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut up.
Big date tonight?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Where are your parents?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
You're learning.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Uh huh, pleasure.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
He succeeded.
No.
Nothing remotely like this.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
Yes, but...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Are you religious?
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
I don't know.  I think so.
It's been six years.
No... no... no...
Yes... I remember Mary
What is this?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
What's wrong?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
No...
You're his sister, right?
Is there something we can do?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So?
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Hey...wake up.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
She doesn't want me around
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
But how...?
Sobering...
Alice...
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
What's that got to do with it?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Who's Jacob?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Poor woman...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
You hear that?
Somewhere down there?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Yeah. I know about that.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Yeah.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
What do you want, then?
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Huh?
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
So?
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Forget it.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You've been married twice --
I know your parents.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
He got his deer yet?
Just do it.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Where's Ma?
Love! I'm made of love!
Rolfe.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
No shit.
What about Margie?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Uh, we got a problem here.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Dead.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you know of my husband?
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Finally, we can bargain.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Someone should give you a raise.
Yeah, right.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Other way around, sir.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
What?
What's the story?
Yes I did...
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Sir?
Elaine, we have to go back.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Simon, what's happening?!
Go ahead.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Scraps.
Sure.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I don't want to live anymore.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
You folks need any help?
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Headquarters!? What is it?
What's his problem?
Ted...
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I like my horizons narrow.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
What's this?  What's going on?
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
What was that about?
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
We can't let him get away.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
This floor's freezing.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
HOW MUCH TIME?
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Amy.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That the atmosphere processor?
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Corporal Hicks!?
What's he scanning for?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Well you're not reading it right!
They'll get us.
What's this?
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
What did you say?
Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
You promise?
Did you ever have a baby?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
That's right.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
You might be disappointed.
What did you think of the music?
No, she's fine.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I want to go back to Vienna.
Stop it!
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
What?
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's doing his best.
When, may I ask?
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Hey!
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I don't know. He has pains.
Opera? Opera!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Oh, Excellency, would you?
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
No, please.
Where did I stop?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
And that's it. Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
I am so ashamed.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
What do you want?
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
What?
What difference does that make?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Here I am, my angel.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
I agree, Baron.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
Herr Salieri.
Go about your duties.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
I beg your pardon?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
That's easy enough.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Are you better now?
Your dead friend Jack?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Don't you remember?
I should be committed.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Oh, come on, tell us.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
So they said.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
A coyote.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Shut up, you zombie!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
I wanted to see you.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Hello.
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Sorry, love.
No.
Oh.
No, thank you.
He has?
Whose death?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
You understand?
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well—
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not interested in what you think.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Good morning.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Where is he now?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I already told him I was home.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Is it safe?
He's at a board meeting.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Why?
What did you do with it?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's keeping you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
They must have turned him down.
Did you talk to him?
Yes, why?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
—for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
He's smiling.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
What have you done?
Yesterday.
Nope.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Oh no...
You have no shame.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
Thanks for the help.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
I got us through the War all right.
Still smells fishy.
We'll make them pay for this.
Cannon or Gatling?
Which one, right or left?
Where is Jesse James?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
My little Web did that?
Web died fighting?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Such as?
Web's dead.
"Big and older"?
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah, Jimmy?
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Easterners.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
And what's this right girl like?
Where will you find such a girl?
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Well, not exactly.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
How can that be?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
So he's won.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pick me up?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Why don t you just go for Price?
We need to talk.
Yes, I am.
Where are you going?
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Yes, naturally.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Uh huh.
Don't, I'll drink it.
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
You didn't give them a name.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Why?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matinée of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Don't tell him you're here.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Understandable.  Lime?
Where did you go to school?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Hmmm.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Al.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Yes, Owen?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
He's your boss. He's not your --
Isn't that -- extreme?
What're you -- what?
...Whaddo I do?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
You look beautiful.
Here we go.
It's gonna get cold.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Milo?
Okay.
What?!
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
We tried!
Milo? I'm Danny.
Cool!
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
I do!
What're you implying.
I meant did you find other stuff to --
The wrong place?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Keep looking.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You're famous around here.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Were you?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
Why were you snooping in my office?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Meet me at the other location.
It's three years old, it --
...He knows.
Latitude 47 degrees.
What d'you mean?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
She's a programmer?
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Hey, how are you?
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
She's working on another lead right now.
Be careful.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Good on ya, man.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I beg your pardon?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Of course, luv.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Are you crazy?
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
In due time.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
What about his teeth?
No, he's really evil.
Seriously?
Knight ...
Love...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
I have an appointment.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
And just what is the game?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
What on earth?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
You followed me.
Yes ... ?
I thought you played by the rules.
Winning isn't everything.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Steed
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
You're better than I expected.
You are, and it's behind you.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The car for Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Nice shot.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Let go of me!
A real turd.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
It's true.
Hookers beat you up?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
You want to share it?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
It's on the tenth floor.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
My Debbie?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Not likely.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Trychticholorate.
I need another one, sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
So what do you want me to do?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
No need to be modest, Brian.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
I was ahead of my time.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
I want 15 on the Mets.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
This psycho can.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
...Benedict Arnold...
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
We're ready when you are.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
So that's what you been doing?
Good morning, Cheeba.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
We was coming to see you.
You're now Mantan.
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
Go on.  Good so far.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
That's what I'm askin'.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
What is your problem?
Thanks.
How so?
Yes, your name?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
No.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
You've never had any formal training, either?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
She hates dem.
You slept too near where you got in?
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
What else?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Have you had one?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Good night, papa.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
It's... too slow.
Some.
That son of a bitch.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
He -- He made me do it --
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Epilepsy.
What business?
Back up.
Why?
We just want to check your pack --
But not the only victim, right?
What happened to "degrees"?
But you didn't.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
I don't know --
Where are they!
How are you?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
And the problem is you only got three.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
I'm not even going to dignify that --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
The very same.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
What?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Dunbar.
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Little bit.
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
For what?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Bullshit --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Sir, yes, sir!
Will.
How long have you known my father?
Did you see that woman?
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Really.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Am I?
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
So how does it happen?
I thought you weren't dying.
Son?
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
The river.
Really.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
Hello.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Was she one of your teachers?
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
It's enough isn't it?
What do you mean?
Do you want to stop?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Hello.
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No. It is too judgmental.
What did he say? Tell me!
Is that everything?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
I don't understand.
I don't want to know.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
So uh...
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes neither.
What?
It wasn't what I wanted.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
What?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
You know you can come under the blanket.
Okay. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
At church?
Hey.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
I keep the heat on.
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Itches.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
By myself?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Uh-huh.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You get a call from Rose?
Goin' dove huntin'?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Yeah?
What happened to your face?
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I think she got to you, pappy.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Getting very weird.
Squid?
What'd she say?
Cool?
Give me a break, would you?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Why weren't you at the platform?
What'd I tell you?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
She disappeared... shit!
I'm not drunk...
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
We're in?
Keep the change.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Save it, I already took the tour.
I'm amused.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
You want him dead too.
What's the point?
One man.  He must be good.
Would you like to be modified?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
You got a machine on it yet?
Yeah.
When might that be?
Okay, but...
I know all that.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
My job is here.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
Jeezus!
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
So?
Yeah.
I told you I'd come back.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Because it's not.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
She didn't know?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
But I understand what you mean.
How do you do?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
What's wrong with you?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Heck, no!  What?!
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
No.
I think it's the eyes.
See, ya.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Thank you.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
I didn't know that.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Could we talk about that a little later?
You said it would be easy!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
About clothing?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
What about her?
Really?
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
...the pipe tobacco.
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
When did we get it from them?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
Bye, Adam!
You dial nine to get out.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
I don't see anything!
How do you do, ma'am.
I'll be all right.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
We have to go.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
To go up.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
He's smart.
Give me your hand.
He go back to the hotel?
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Give it back to him.
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Are you Detective Williams?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
No, not at all.
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
I wanted to see you.
Well.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Do you know?
I liked being with you last night.
Nice guy. Who's he?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
I'm doing it.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
I asked first.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Hello, baby.
MOMMY!
Where are we going, Frank?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Heineken.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
What time are visiting hours?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
What's the plan.
Who, me? Why should it?
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Jeffrey? Why?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Go ahead.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Yes sir.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
What?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Fuck!
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That was way easier than I thought.
Nine bodies.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You feel?
Yes.
You're right.
Yes.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Would they do that?
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Dignan, calm down.
Where's the other stocker?
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
OK. Go ahead.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
You don't know how to hotwire.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
When'd you get back?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Do you like Inez?
Uh-huh?
Come on.
What?
You think Applejack knew?
How big is it?
What's he in for?
You're kidding.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Did Dignan take the test?
No, that door over there.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Yeah.
Who?
Did you ever steal a car before?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Let them fight.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Dies y nueve.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
Were you born in Mexico?
The front stairs.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
I don't know about that.
So who's going to know?
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What was that all about?
That's your domain.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
What is it?
Not bad.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
The elevator broke.
You keeping out of trouble?
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Got a little lucky.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.
And the Landy woman?
What do you mean?
Don't know.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Then what?
You know I'm not.
What do you want?
I don't know.
Pamela Landy?
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
I should be better by now.
But we were so careful.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
What?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
I killed him???
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Abbott?
No. You never worked Berlin.
My first job.
Where am I?
What's that?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
What?
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Are you an expert in amnesia?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
He was a modest man.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
You mock us with a smile?
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
That's just a dream, William!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
You win.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Thank you for inviting.
Did it work?
I've missed you.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
We can't stop!
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
But you must have something to go on?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
I don't know... I don't remember.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Straight up.
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I just thought you should know.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Then you think it might have worked out?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Lung cancer?
Meant no offense.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Lenny? Come on!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
I came with Captain Renault.
My husband is with me, too.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, please.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Goodnight.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
-- Tonight he forgot.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It's not for sale.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
No.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
I don't understand. What about you?
Hello, Sam.
Where is Rick?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
What happened with Rick?
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Ilsa, I --
Yes.
And I congratulate you.
Your work.
No, Captain, please.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Yes.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Hello, Louis.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
What, again?
This is the end of the chase.
Okay.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
You're late.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I have. Sit down over there.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
There seems to be no secret about that.
Boss!
You ever going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
No. Not me, boss.
Yeah, boss?
Just a little something of my own.
It's bad.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
It's real.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
He's your cute thing.
I have to.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Yeah?
I am one lucky guy.
If you say you are.
I most definitely say I am.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I've never seen a lobster.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
*What* will be okay?
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Nothing.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
At what altitude?
They're migrants.
There was no visible wound?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Of course.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
They told me I was too old to serve.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Silicon Valley?
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Nice.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Stake you?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Come here. Feel this.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Something stupid.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
What the hell's his problem?
What?
Look at you... You want to go.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you deal with --
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
What do you want? An apology?
Your mess.
Meet me at my place later.
We're working for the King.
Why?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Eee Oott Auught!
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Can't say.
A Fed? Is he close?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Jack. Do you need a ride?
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
Who was he?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
How did you land that?
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
You're shaking. What is it?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Marion. It's a book.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Really?
I hate public transport.
Oh hello.
First visit to London?
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Just an accident. Nothing.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I can't do it, Jani.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Where do you live, Jack?
She's my baby.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Has he?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
Five.
I make it six.
Girlfriend?
Very impressive.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
How do you feel, Jack?
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
The key!
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Thanks.
Hello, bomb.
But how do you know you exist?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
That is correct.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Yes.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Oh yeah?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Leave.  Now.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Where?
Unlikely.
Please...
So are dogs.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Who are you?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
You left out condescending.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
She was the one--
True, but--
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Hawk.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Namely?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
But, mom!
They're not idiots.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I did?
What happened?
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Beg pardon?
I'm not following you.
I want to show you something.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Hey...
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
We're moving through time.
What? How long was I asleep?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
So how was school today?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Who is Frank?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Nothing.
Yes.
Then how is time travel possible?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Come again?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
That's enough.
Beg pardon?
But now you can't go.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
There's no rule!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Thank God for bunge cords.
Okay.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Your parents'd kill you.
Amber...
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Go on! Get out!
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Bye mom.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
I know.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, naw. Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
That bitch from...
All right, then.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
My dear President...  read it back...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
Well - what is he now?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
I don't remember.
What'll I do with this card?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
You stay with me.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Yes?
I found it.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
I want my man back.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How long has this man been here?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
Have you read it?
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
You alright?
Yes.
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
Oh yes.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
And who might you be, sir?
Right! Where is he?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
It's all right! It isn't happening!
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
WHY?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Of course.
I... but I...
I'll tell you what...
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What about the raping?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
"But" what?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
What?
I... I... KILLED her...
SHUT UP!
What "magic"?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
You need to say a bit more than that!
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Bye, Leif.
How did he do that?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You know, my son, our lord said...
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
He used to puke in his sleep.
Get away, Snorri.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Sh! Hurry!
It's a tradition.
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
Thanks, guys.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Why what?
It's okay, really.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I'm sure you would.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Yes?
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Yeah.
I like to read.
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
No.
You'll call me, right?
How can you watch this crap?
No.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Really? Is he cute?
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
We did talk about Naomi.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Okay.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You said...
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
It's dark.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I'm nervous, too.
I don't know.
I just walked in.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Yeah?
How's it going?
That's me.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
It's them.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Oh! Great. That's great!
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
What?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
I know what it is.
Stan? What's going on?
Mary. What are you doing here?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Tell me about it.
What do you think?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
But Countess...
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
But Justin...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Patch me through to him.
This is Weir.
I can see the hatch.
Alive?
Peters...
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
Yes.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
What is it, Smith?
Smith, get out of there...
Where is it, where is it...
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It tastes bad.
Oxygen is not the problem.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
You've got to listen...
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Where is she?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I wouldn't know anything about that.
What about his first born?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
For science.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Raising the shields.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
You want to work at Carl's?
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
I take out the garbage.
They're not home yet.
Well... it's true.
You are a virgin!
They were left over from the last shift.
Yes, sir.
Get a ride with somebody.
Well...
Pick a suit.
What's wrong?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Damone. It's Mark.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Damone! You come here?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Was it great?
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Climax together.
No. But it's a nice idea.
How long does Doug take?
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
He's not coming.
But what are you going to do?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
The point sounds fine.
This is a nice car.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Two Cokes.
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
A major!
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Shoot it.
That's good...
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
No, she's looking for you.
It's gone too far.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
We're better off.
What now, Geronimo?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Oh.
Oh, no.
But --
Huh?
Two.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Move slow and move quiet.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
Let's go!
Get to your cars!
You know you don't have to do this.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Well...
Frances?  Oh no.
Putting on my armor.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
You're afraid!
Good, good. Give them that.
Hello, Harold.
He's not here.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Sort of.
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
...I see.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
What do I do, Dad?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
...So what do you think?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Bread?
Age?
I wouldn't miss it.
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Think I'll have a glass.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Where are we, mean man?
I guess.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
What's that?
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
I live here.
That's me, Clifford.
The speech? Real good.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Excuse me.
I don't believe so.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Oh! Are you really?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
You drove him to his torment.
Come warm yourself if you like.
I don't know.
What can I do?
Friend?
And if I consent?
What is this?
She's beautiful.
Nothing. Still nothing.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Have you seen Willie?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
What kind of God is He to will this?
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Your decision. For us.
Victor. I love you,
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Why the change? What about your work?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
A warming wind.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Electricity.
Who are you?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
Tomorrow is another day.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
How the... did he get in there?
Let's go back, Barry...
I had to.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
Looks like a storm.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
One night on the town.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
I said new, this is an '90.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
What's this guy's problem?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Real McCoy.
Why'd ya quit?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
Now, is your shit together?
I promise.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Yeah.
Yeah, we got a bible.
I'm really sorry.
See ya.
-- you got your sink --
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
Best in Mexico.
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
All I'm saying --
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
What?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
You know what you look like?
What do you mean?
Who's "we"?
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Of course, but there's more --
Oh, really.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Entering my scan now...
Did you hear?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
So dump on me.
Me?  Why me?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Which is guy-speak for...
They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.
I think you look beautiful.
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
You knew about us?
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
Most people don't.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
I can't.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Hence the radiation.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
They didn't make it.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Somebody must have seen it.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
It's the French Secret Service.
Are you sure? How do you know?
What's with the chewing gum?
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
God, what an ass.
We've got to stop!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
Yes. Good was done this .....
A boy comes to the door.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What do you mean?
Shit! Go!
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Never mind, Fred....
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
We're alive!
It's Jason...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
I heard it too.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Weapons storage...
Commander...
You what?.. What are you talking about?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
Anything.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
While they're strung out?
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Yes, general?
Well, what have you thought?
No, my lord.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
What is this?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who's in command out there?
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Partially...
We already have black soldiers in our army...
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
They help me understand why we fight.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
I... they look both the same.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Martha!  For God's sake!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
All people have rights!
Yes!
I see...
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
No. What's this?
Calm down, Bear...
You can talk to me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
What money?
Where's Karen?
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
I'm working on a few things.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
You live in Miami?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
I'm looking at you.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Part of it, yeah.
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
You pack a gun?
What does that mean?
Ever shot anybody.
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
How about this?
That's not bad.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
The door from the patio, in back.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
"Cotton".
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
You thought I was faking?
What took you so long?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Harry -–
Which two?
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Let's not be too hasty.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
What day is it?
What is your first name?
What?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
This's gonna hurt a little.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Try Wednesday.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Turbine rotor's shot.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
You mean, before she sank.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
What?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Same. Any luck?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
February first.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
Hey.
Not our mystery guest again.
That much I think we've already established.
What happened?
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Murphy, goddamit.
What happened?
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
What about the gold?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Someone from the past.
Give up?
What is it now?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
Yeah, I heard about that.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Nothing.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Good.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Where?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
That rules!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You're gross.  See that guy?
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What are you talking about? Who?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Nothing.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Wow... finally.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Punk rock is over!
That's five hundred dollars.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Aren't you going to get that?
What? You're kidding me...
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
And you like them?
What's up?
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I dunno, I...
God, Dana's going to kill you!
I will if you want to.
I agree.
No... they said she was here...
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
There is no reason for fear.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
Am I to take it you want to live?
Starting now, we attack them.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Don't they, though?
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
John, it will not be easy.
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
Actually, no.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Has it ever done that before?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Everybody has a choice.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Certainly.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Okay, that's no problem.
Hello, Peter.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
You're really good, you know.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Can I help you?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Pretty impressive, huh?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Eight o'clock?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
That's too bad.
Are you all right?
On a purely scientific basis.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
He is the Destructor.
That is one speedy mutt.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Great!  How's it going?
No, you may not.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Circle?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Why not?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
You talked to Gozer?
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Sorry, Buddy!
Set entry grid.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
Who was the architect?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
You're coming back?
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Give away food?
Take grain away from the army?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Why you?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Where are they?
They're studying with Cynics.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Narcissus!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Who the hell are you?
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you want some dinner?
No -- why should I?
What?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No, I couldn't.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Where we going?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Do you?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
What's the matter?
Where are you meeting this person?
All right then! Yes!
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Don't tell me --
The marble?
I'll think about it.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
Why do you have to see him?
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
You're not one of those agitators?
What did you do to her?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
What?
It's in the main ballroom.
Yes sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Is it a girl?
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Drink?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Her portrait?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Don't be nervous.
Now?
Yes?
Yes.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Benjamin.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Thank you.
Go ahead then.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Thank you.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Is it?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.
Yes.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Now don't start this.
If that's how you feel --
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
How?
Where is Elaine?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
They don't know?
Have you thought about graduate school?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Sir?
What?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
That's quite a statement.
HUH?
Yes?
Yes?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Have you a minute now?
I want to speak --
And what are you going to do?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
How?
Like dancing?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Reducing?
Too bad.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
What can you see?
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
The Baron is tired?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Well -- last night was not so good.
The war.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
No, Doctor.
Any letters?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Later?
That's from skiing.
What?
Can't you understand me?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
No -- now.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
Well?
I understand perfectly.
A thousand marks -- 
All right.
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Sorry, Preysing. 
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Me?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
No. No word.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
What's bluff?
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You know it, Lilly.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Want a look?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Whadaya say?
What's up?
No?
What happened to your hand?
Not as tough as you, huh?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Get off the grift, Roy.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
You must have some money.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
You're too young. You should be in school.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Are you sure?
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
Is that right?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I don't think I need it.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Ate the gun. Oh.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
Carter.
Yes.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Do you know who did this?
No shit?!
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Now you're joking, right?
No.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
What?  Where is she?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You look kind of cold.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
This kid just wants his freedom.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Can't you hold it?
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Let the party begin.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Aren't you gonna answer that?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
You've been watching too much TV.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where are you going?
Where's the baby?!
Where's the child?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
You've created a monster.
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
You know what gets me?
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Go home!
How do you know that?
You told me.
Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
You're an imbecile.
Insurance!
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
For Africa.
Out!
Hello.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
They were in the same creative writing class.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Can't it keep till morning?
Who was it?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Sir?
Not at all.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
We thought a doctor might help.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Turn around?
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You're wrong.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
That's what you're supposed to say.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Fish can't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Go on.
The doctor.
No you don't.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
He's dead, you know.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
I was going to ask.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
It died for your sins.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
I see.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Can't do it.
What are you going to do?
It was a bitch.
She did?
Premature ejaculation.
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I know.
Still lives with his mother.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I don't really know.
Yes, he is.
Everything stays as it is!
He isn't?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
Yeah.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
How long has this been going on?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
It's true.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
It's good.  Let him go.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
Just one.
Yeah.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Overpowering?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Yeah.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Neither am I.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
Where is he?
Mast?
What are you paying me for?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
What do you mean?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
No.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Does she know anything about this?
How did you find me?
What?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
Rucker.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
This is from the movie I was talking about.
But I...
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What's that?
Com'on, tell me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
You working in San Diego now?
Was he with a girl?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
None of that, lady.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
What do you want?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Harold?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
I don't know. Perhaps.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Oh, Harold. 
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I'm getting married.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Oh, is this your father?
No. My uncle.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
And a lot of time.
What about the draft?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Harold?
No.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Yes.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
You knew?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
It's a beautiful dress...
I... I had a visitor.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
See what??
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
That's all for you, Sammy.
Here. You'll need one of these.
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
It's almost over!!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Grounded? Who's grounded?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
Those things never work. Never.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
No. I never was.
Goodnight, then.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
But it's not true, is it?
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
It's my lucky day.
Will you sign for the bed?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
I'm brother Frank.
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
What?
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
Hi. I got soaked.
Where's Daddy?
I have to see my father.
How long since you were here?
You're still blaming me.
Where are you?
Why not?
Is it deep?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Can I get you anything?
Please...
What's wrong?
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
There's a first time for everything.
Well, isn't it?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
First time for everything.
What a pretty tune.
What did you say?
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Never better. You sleep well.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
Get the fuck out of here.
I thought we'd lost you.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
What's next?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
Not the point.
What did he ever do to you?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
What's up?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
No.  We need the gig.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
We work there!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Hey, Barry.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What's his name?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Good weekend?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
I think you know that.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
But what?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough, Liz.
It's a great song.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
I'm sure it isn't.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I'll call you.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Nice.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
It's my birthday.
Why?
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
I don't follow you.
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Someone beat you.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You're a fool.
Not all of them.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I'm not even sure why.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You kill with your left hand?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
The inheritance.
Forget it.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
What do you want from me?
All fashionably without heads.
What were you doing in Felton?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
Aye.
Why are you here?
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Go to hell.
I feel hardly nothing.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Some think not.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
No doubt.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
You seem to understand a great deal.
We have no understanding.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Are you sure?
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
You're insane.
Run!
What's the point?
Are you here?
Did you know the victim?
No.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?... The poem was great!
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Oh, it isn't like that.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Well, she'll know some day.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
What?!!
No, I can't.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Where's Bruce?
Double-crossing swine!
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Hold the phone!
Gus, this --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What do I know about Williams?
That's murder!
Just one second --
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Pure politics!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
No -- don't out me off.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Who is this man?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Mother!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Huh?
Pinkus.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
Why?
Give him the you-know-what.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Sod.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Crocodiles! Aah!
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
And Jim.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I wish it could all have been different.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
How long have you been running this place?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
But if you did.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
Yeah, no shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
How long is that gonna take?
Oh.
Tickets for what?
I resign.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
What'd we here, Georgie?
You find something, Georgie?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Where's Bill?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
Tell him, Harold.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Shall we close up, then?
Yes. Happy happy.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
What is it?
Urgh.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Well?
God, you're beautiful.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
Hunh.
Lila?
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
What do you mean?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
As do I.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
I'm not sure.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
I'm sorry?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
What SPF, sweetie?
Yes, darling.
Absolutely.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Good. Making progress.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Puff, put the gun down.
Boys just passing through?
And a fact is a fact.
Do we need words?
That's the way it's done.
I lost twenty bucks.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
To do what?
Why?
You think I can lose?
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Sign up.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.
I can beat him.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Yeah, that's right.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Go to hell.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
What time?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
What's the limit?
Gimme ten bucks.
Call it.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Around.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
You told me.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Mm hmm.
You going out?
What are you writing?
Give it back to me.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
That's what the game's all about.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Yes.
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
Humans.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Son ... are you awake?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
There are more this year than last.
I'll take you to school.
What's wrong, Ellen?
Yes.
Don't go in.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
What kind, Mom?
I take it you've heard.
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
There's good news and bad news.
What're you talking about?
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
I'm thinking.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
I'm making a mess.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Nice meeting you.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Where's it headed?
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
It had been deemed classified.
Yes, I am.
Really? Ballet?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
But I gave you some this morning.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
You sure?
What the hell's going on?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Yes.
Ah, Venice...
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Look what you did!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Tapestries?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
I usually don't.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Mine, too.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No?
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
...you did it.
Well, uh...
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
And the chair.
What?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
All right Dad -- tell me.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
The penitent man is humble before God.
But, Indy --
Where's my father?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Come one, what's wrong?
Two are still missing.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
What?!
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Any more complaints?
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Oh no -- oh no!!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
I said something.
You're not gonna believe this...
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
It wasn't him.
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Yeah?
Somebody's been here.
With a man in my head...
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I wouldn't say that.
Why? AL  You know too much.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
What do you mean we.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
I don't like the sound of that.
Which way do I go?
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
I can't do that.
Holy shit!
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
Eat it?
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
Which language?
Where is she staying?
I made it work.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Much too blue.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Get close to them.
Just don't show fear.
Voice stress analyzer.
You're doing great with her.
What if she says something important?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
What Happened?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Some agent you are.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
On what?
Sapporo..
I told you, I have a feeling...
What?
He was with Gruner!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
He aready made the deal..
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
She is beautiful.
Awwww...
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What abilities...?
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
**?!! 
How about a deal?
Al Viola.
That name's familiar.
Who...are you?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Joe.
What?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Not you. Them.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
The fresh tuna?..
...Blake
Blake?
And you.
...right here too.
Do what?
Why?
Can I help?
How often they come here?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
I'm just on vacation.
What's he done?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
That must be him. Water taxi.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
Why not?
That I really don't know.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
How?
He can't help us.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
A drink...
Just one. The back up.
Tear it apart?
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
What does he know?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Okay. 
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
How are you, Jim?
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Okay.  Lowell?
You ready...?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
It would be better if he called us.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I disappeared on you?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
How much would I get paid?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Good. But Jeff...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
What are you talking about?
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
So she's uh, flourishing?
What part?
Who's the pigeon?
Triple!
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
I'm happy for you, pal.
What?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
Is Tong older than Ming?
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
But you don't agree?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
He wants a reconciliation.
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
To victory.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
She didn't love you?
No, we're not!
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Huh?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Hi.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I fell in love Miles.
She did a Harriman.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Lilly's up.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Excuse me?
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I'm not sure.
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Who's "Patty."
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What ten thousand?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What've you got against King Westley?
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Oh, no.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
I'm sorry you read it.
If you really mean it, I will.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
You talk as if—
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Any others?
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Huh?
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
What am I going to do now?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Your ego is colossal.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Thanks, professor.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
was so scared—that it scared—
Carrots.
You think it's simple, huh?
Oh, no!
You might give me a little credit.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
I love you.
I hope you got your money.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
I'm hungry.
Yeah? Where?
What!
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
I'd put you there myself.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah, where am I?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Collect?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
That's right.
Yeah—wouldn't it?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Where do you live?
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Did he pay?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Yeah.
I did.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You know damn well who it is.
Calm down, Dave, what?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?
Four to six.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
I'm not sure I understand.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
David Ferrie.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Oh no!... How bad?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Time?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
You know who the mayor was?
No.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Well, thanks for coming.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
That's all you've had all this time?
That sounds fun.
But then you told her you were home.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
Who was there for your ass?
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What's going on?
What's she want?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
Help us do what?
Is it dark?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
No, you didn't. What branch?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's not really something I think about.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Well, hello.
How was it?
I'm old enough to be her father.
I go back to work tomorrow.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
He was here?
I called you last night.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
You know some interesting people.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
The feds. It's evidence.
You're rationalizing.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
In a dress.
Why?
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
I know.
I'm just tired in general.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yes. All those things are true.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I have no idea.
If it'll make you happy.
Do you think I took some of that money?
What were you two fighting about?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
What the hell you doin'?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
They already know it's you.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
That's a good idea.
A woman.
Managers get ten percent.
Uh-huh.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
How do you know she did that?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Bank robbery.
C'mon, don't lie.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Lemme have the bag.
The moon -- I dunno
That was Beaumont.
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
So what, you left her there.
Couldn't talk to her?
What?
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Maybe the Feds got it.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
How can I help you?
What's his full name?
Getting there.
House or apartment?
I can see that. Why?
I got some more business for ya.
Somebody already did.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
I thought you might be asleep.
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
Yeah.
No.
You sure?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
What isn't happening?
Let me out of here!
It's all been a dream.
Dream on!
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
I'm hanging up.
Hey, wait!
Don't go.
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
What do you mean, demons?
Not me, buddy.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Ah!
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
It's freezing.
I moved the couch. That's all.
I must have been out of my head.
She looked good then.
Ready?
Jake!
Why do you bring her up?
Where?
Can't you stop it?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
He did? When?
I don't believe this.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
I don't know you.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
Never?
I no from around here.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
You got a nice tan, though.
Where am I?
Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
I need to see you, Jake.
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Still married, Jake?
Why the hell we drivin' here?
What's wrong?
That black car?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
Oh God. I know. I know.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Died?
Where the hell were you?!!
You see that?
We'd need charges.
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
Sergeant!
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Hey.
That's why I'm here.
Rizzo, you okay?
Well?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
You must shut down the engines.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
Robot huh?
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Ow!
Do I have to?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
What good will that do?
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Did you bring a check?
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
The wire's showing!
What's that one, there?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Right.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Can you do that?
No, it was local jurisdiction.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
What? What?!
How can you tell?
What is all this stuff?
Why don't we just tow it in?
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Just keep kicking.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
We're not even sure what it was.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
He's busy.
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
What do you see?
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
But you copy my work every week.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
We're getting a stretch limo.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Wait, let me take that.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What? I'm not made of stone.
No... I guess not.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
No.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
We don't even have a dog!
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
What do you play?
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Why aren't you at work?
I know what junk is.
We definitely want it to have junk.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Nothing...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
What do you make with that?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
Hm.
What?
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
A hotel?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
What's this?
No it is not!
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
How much do I owe you?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
...I do.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
...and I think I know why.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Up yours.
There's more...
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Who d'ya think you're foolin'?  I know you better than you think...
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
Oh man, that's the best.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
Did she suck your dick?
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Can you do it man?
Who?
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Darcy?
Yeah.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Why not? You stink.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
You goin'?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Sup. Sup.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
You know what I want to do?
Why?
Because your a virgin?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
I tested positive?
You're OK?
Miss, would I be prying?
Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
Telly says was up.
Did you bleed?
Wish me luck.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
And you don't get shit out of it.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
You think so?
Hi mom.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
You want a wip-it?
So, how many people live here now?
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
By yourself?
You are!  I don't like you.
What?
No.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
You want me to what?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
To get your attention.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
You'll find her.
Hello?
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
What word did you leave last night?
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
What are you doing up?
What about prints?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
The most logical choice.
Through a rental agency.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Are we going to go through this again?
About what?
I can check and call you back.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
How come you don't stay with them?
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
They couldn't break the riddle.
I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
Of course.
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Why?
I know you didn't
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
She died in a car accident.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Nothing.
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Why?
Why not?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
You have done it?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
I cannot betray my bride.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
I have need of friends.
You and I will guard the fire.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
And where do you lead, boy?
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
You!
We'll meet you at the inn.
I have a cinnamon bar.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Would you desert your friends?
We have plenty of hares.
Food for crows.
They'll trample him to death!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
Yes. We lost five.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
The Widow of the Web?
Do not try your trickery on me!
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
No.
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
OK, I'm fine.
Who'll I aim at?
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
The yellow and pink.
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
No.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda?!
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Poor darling, and then?
Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yes?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
But... He works for your same employer?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Where?
What is it?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
No it's not.
Maybe later.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I know what you're getting at.
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
You thought I sent them?
Ellen?
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
No.
I don't know.
Doubts?  About what?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
You tell stories?
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Yes.
She knew you loved her.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Come on Mr. Parker.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
You're pretty drunk.
Sarah -- with an H?
You what?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
I know that...
Giving you money makes me want to come.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
How'd this happen?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
Where have you been?
Yes? What?
Yuri... are you...
I loved him!
Go to hell.
What's going on?
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
No.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
You're hitting on me?
So everything you just said --
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Good one.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
Here. You're gonna need this.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
You really think I'm attractive?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
How could this happen?
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
You should. Do you have a resume?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Your what?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
No.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Yes.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Always.
My generosity is not so large as that.
Your love.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
You're magnificent.
Why have you brought me here?
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Yes?
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Might we watch, too?
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Gump, is it?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
But... but, why?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
The colt's still too small.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
I should hope not!
We'll find it.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Easily spoken...
There isn't much time!
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Don't get too far!
Never show mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
You promised!
Sport, indeed.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What shall we do?
What's the matter?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
I don't want it on me.
My lady mocks me.
What have I done?
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
I can't see a thing.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Exceeding fair.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
You'll visit again?
Courage, Jack.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
In every way.
Wondrously so.
Jest with me then.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Heading north still?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
You've been inside?
What color?
And why was the alarm on?
I'm going to bed.
I had them in my pocket.
Can you keep Sam straight?
Where to?
You look better without make-up.
I don't want you to!
It would help me if I could kiss you.
You hate your father.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Pardon me?
How's your wife?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Maybe that's too long.
What can I do for you, George?
She didn't really say.
I didn't recognize you!
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
I don't know.
I'll ask.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Probably in the bible.
No.
I hate turkey.
Why?
It'll be fine.
You're too fucking late.
I'm not even listening.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
What would you like to be?
Nothing.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
I loved him too much.
Are you taking them still?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Good for you.
God, you look like crap, George.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
What?
Why would they tow your truck?
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
I can't leave the house?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
With your hands or your tongue?
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Where's Sam?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I thought we were helping.
What did I say?
Let's not do this, okay?
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Does Alyssa know?
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
That's the problem.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Hey.
Do you know anything about building a house?
I didn't go in your room.
All day again?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Dad's home, already?
He's a big one.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yeah...
Yeah.
Why not?
She got married last month.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Start your job? What kind of job?
A loan officer?
How would I get a loan, anyway?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
So?
No, man. I want you to have it.
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What does that mean?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
What am I gonna eat?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
'Course I was right. About what?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
So?
Where am I at, man?
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
Just like Elvis.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
What's going on here?
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Blacks welcome there?
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
We could create our own hell there.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Where is he? He's late.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
So far, so good. Now what?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
It's Stanley, sir.
Boogerland!
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Looking for the chief.
This don't look good.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You gotta kill yourself.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
What was that?
What were you thinking coming here?
What are you doing?
What do you mean, "possessed?"
Nicky!
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Why is that funny?
It looks like the work of a brother...
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
All right -- what are you?
Where do you send them?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
Just wondered... what happens?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
No.  Just no.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Maybe... sure...
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I let him go... believe me.
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
I -- I can't.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I doubt it.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What belongs to the people?
We'll have to bury him.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Gracious... no.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
You're not contagious are you?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Yeah, I remember.
I don't know.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I don't know.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Okay...
Set.
You killed him.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Never saw him before in my life.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Where's Pete?
Who is it?
A headache?
That's it.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
It must be from a real estate agent.
What night?
I called, you know.
What was that?!!!
What job?
Was there?
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
You like pornos?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
What's goin' on?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
You really don't remember?
I was?
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I beg your pardon.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Charming chap.
Nothing. Why?
Well - I'm—
Where is your mad pilot?
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, it must have taken–
Yes, charming.
Suppose she should leave it?
Yes.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Oh, immediately.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
Sondra Bizet.
Mine?
Oh, stop it!
What is it? Has he fainted?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Is that all my story meant to you?
I'd go mad!
What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
What about the others?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Where were you hiding?
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Struggling, why?
Why?
I was just going to.
What do you want him to do?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
All the time, sir.
You do?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
Sir--
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Why?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
It's marble.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Goodwill...
Nowhere.
They're not my pals--
This it?
I'm getting a trajectory...
Agatha --
Oh, God...
Where are we going?
Someplace safe.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
You don't remember me, do you?
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
Victim's a white female.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Lara --
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm not getting halo'd.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Yeah?  So?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
They don't belong to anybody.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
You're alive?
I forgive you.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
What about the picture --
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
If... you have one.
Which one is that?
He's dead, Lara.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Sean --
Tell him not now.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Can't they shut that off?
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
He looks familiar.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
This your work?
It was nobody's fault.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Thank you very much, sir.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Thank you, sir.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Should I fuck him?
I know.
Uncle Bobby?
What time is it there?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm ready.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
I feel weird asking him.
I want you to quit.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
What'd you say?
I said no touching.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
When's it going down?
Yeah?
Where's Ricky.
A million. Easy.
She was fast, huh?
No.
Ruiz knows about this?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Where's the drop?
What's that?
'Trustafarians?'
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Any time, bro.
Don't be shitty.
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Ask if he said anything to her.
I thought you hate that club.
He didn't say we need guns.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Sorry coach.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I gotta pick up the baby.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
How much was it?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
I don't know.
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
What's up?
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Let's check out the penguins.
Did you hear what he just said?
We need guns.
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Eighty five.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
C'mon...
Where's the surprise?
What?
He's on the list.
The videos.
Yes.
'Strapped?'
See you later.
You really in trouble?
Does anyone want another?
You're from LA, right?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes, sir.
She poured it for --
And where might that be?
Dip?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
Daddy, where's my money?
What you talking?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
What?
How do you like it?
Did you hear what I said?
What do you think?
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Dear heart, where are you?
Is my family here yet?
Can I ask you something?
She know?
I ain't stupid.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Did you hear me?!
How many you turning out?
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Let me die then.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
Watch your tongue, boy.
He told you that?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[The what?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I believe you.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
So how's business?
You been working?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Potential? I don't understand.
Did you used to?
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
Could I ask you a question?
Could I stop you?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Planned what?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[You have the money.]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Our child's safety is at stake.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Where?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Yes, I know.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Please...
I'd like that very much.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I heard you, Ma.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Okay.
Where?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
What?
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
I have a tent to myself.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
We stand behind all our work.
No, no, that one.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Second pint.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
What's wrong with him?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
What's that, Henry?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Against anything. Just protest.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Yes, sir.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
A third party?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
A deal?
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
The heelots!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
A what?
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Oh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Apartment 306.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
I hate fucking Springfield.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
I think I can handle that one.
You know the ten commandments?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
The 6 horse is still last.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You're crazy.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I know how you feel, Ray.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
You think I didn't need you?
You crazy? With all those people around?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Your concern is heartwarming.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
Roper...
What have you promised them?
She said I have a son...
What's happening?
You were the one who was dying.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
But what if he doesn't --
Where you plugged-in from?
Try harder.
Why?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Where?
Need the disk back!
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
I know.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
We've got him locked!
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
That's pretty bad.
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
Two thirty three a.m.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
That was a CHEAP shot!
How the heck?!...
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
So what happened?
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I got my partner in there!
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
It's a mask.
Who'll make the rules?
Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Where we headed?
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
You get fifteen percent.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Forget it. That's past.
We were overdue to get hit.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
What a cozy little scene.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Take any one ya like.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
Monkeybone?
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Bitchin' good cake.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
How was it? I don't recall.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Stu...Stu...
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Who told you we deal drugs?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Behind the books.
I don't want to talk about it.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
And where is she?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Moscow.
This way?
Forty-five all total.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
It was?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Tell me why!
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Waiter!
Diz--
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
One minute! Just one minute!
Henry Hill.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
*But you never asked me*!
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
Jeff for Senator.
A pet shop?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Hello, Jefferson.
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Office of--Senator Smith?
The man downstairs said number--
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
Punch?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
You mean--here?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Since sixteen or so.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Why?
You--don't know it, do you?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
But--I've done everything I--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
How are the pigeons?
Oh--you are!
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
How's that, buddy?
Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
Let's get away from here. 
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
Why don't you do it yourself?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
That's him. Let him in.
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Who's that?
Pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Are these the articles?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
Sure. I met you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What are they going to do?
It's wonderful.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What's the matter, hon?
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You're a fool, Babe.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Had the boys follow us.
Sure.
What're you going to do?
That's the rub.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
I wish you luck, sir.
You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Mr. Cedar!
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Huh?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Me, sir?
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Shall I call the police, sir?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Doubtful. What did he say?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
...And I from Phyllis.
I see.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
What brought this on?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
What?
Oh, I don't know...
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- you crazy? You can't do this!
You're good.
What's wrong with her?
How are you?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Finally, some common sense...
I think you know what I mean.
I think you do.
What?
No.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
Mom's such a cutie.
Something's bothering her.
No.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Hello.
Mother...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
In maybe three or four issues.
Was it something that happened at school?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Uh-huh.
Would you like another beer?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Slash what?
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
And a birth certificate is enough?
English Lit.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Really?
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Who the hell are these guys?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
You shall see.
What just happened?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
You will not believe it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Fifty percent.
Yeah, I was there.
Preparation for what?
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Why would I do that?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You lied to me!
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Juicy?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
She's my sister, actually.
Tough break.
Except for one little thing.
Me, too.
Should I kill them?
And the light goes out...
Hi.
Alone tonight?
Sure.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
GET MAD!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Why not?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
Agents?
So where's the art?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
The Obliterators!
Wow.
But... the silverware?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Hi.
Do we have to?
Are you sure he's still lives here?
It's time.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
Ah -- you approve?
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
I very much doubt that he will.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Well, you shall see.
Ah, that is good.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
No.
Were they pretty?
Promise me you will never leave me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
That's all I can say.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You wrote it.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Alright, I'll remember that.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Where you going?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Me neither.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Damn, you got a stalker.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
I ain't trying to get in it.
I hope to God that dog is happy.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
What you say?
Get on.
Huh?
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
I'll take you later.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
My back.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Sorry.
I need your help.
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
You were very nervous.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
Good luck.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Come with us, sir.
Yes, yes, I understand.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What would you do in my place?
You killed him.
Come back.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
I think you better put that away.
Lynn!
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
I promise.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
That's pretty good.
You're a big girl, huh?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
Leavin', boy?
Uncle Birdie!
Don't!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Hing, hang, hung.
You better not sing that song.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
Dead.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
What's taking you so long about it?
Yes. Yes.
I'll tell.
Yes?
About our secrets.
No.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
No, Harry! I thought --
Harry, what --
I -- no, I --
Answer me!
I been bad!
When did I ever?
Uh-oh...
Yeah. So?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
Who?
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
She lived there.
Mother, for petesakes.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Bring me forty-five back.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
May I ask how much your rooms are?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
The Duchess...
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
I am, Gaston.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
We can wait.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
If you want to see us you must come later.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
A cow?
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
You want me to go in there?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
What business?
But you had!
I think so too.
Why should I take a chance?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Me?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
And where are we?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
So that is your house?
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Ni-notchka.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's twelve o'clock.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I must go.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
As a representative of Moscow...
Just smile.
Why?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Probably not.
No.
Yes.
You see I couldn't shout that.
You must, darling.
Would that make you any happier?
Let's turn on the radio.
...but big.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
Months, Swana.
All right, I'll listen.
She's gone, Leon.
Good morning.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
That's all right... I grow on people.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Where are they?
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
May I ask what has happened?
Raw carrots and beets.
At Père Mathieu's.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
This is June twentieth?
I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn big mouth wife of his.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who?
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Silence!
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What about happiness, Mother?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Thank you for coming, Dick.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
The lie?
Uh, wait ...
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
We got the press this time!
Don't you want to listen to Brown's victory speech?
Amen to that.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Are you serious?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I've missed you.
Are you okay?
Penny for your thoughts.
Congratulations, Dick.
Yes.
You.  What' you're doing --
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
That man that shot you died in prison.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
He's real all right.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
No I ain't.
Would you tell me if you had?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
What about yours?
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
What do you think.
You gave your word?
To your husband.
I need to know that.
What're you doin', baby?
So... for how long do we have to...
You can't afford one?
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh-huh.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Where does he work?
Mm-hm.
I don't know.
Why would I care where you're going.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
What way would that be?
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well... I need to close now --
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
For what?
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
What kind of tent?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
What room?
It's all right.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
The what?
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Another additional.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
How would you describe him?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
I'm a welder.
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Are you in the service?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Need something else?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
You knew Del?!
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Ad lib?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
George...
Thanks...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
No. Loma Vista.
Like Rome?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Doctor David Ravell.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Does he know you think he's real?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
...this is your sweater, right?
Where are you going?
Your husband?!
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
No.
Where? Where is she?
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
What do you mean?
I see.  May I?
What'd you get her?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
No... before that.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Yeah, look at me.
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Devil his due.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Vernon Waldrip.
It's just a symbol, honey -
That's right, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
That don't make no sense!
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Yes, sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
I called you Sarge.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
What did you call me, Mayo?
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
That was you guys, huh?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
You hope.
You serious about having him over?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
There's always a choice.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Want me to get a towel?
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Twenty-two years ago.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I'd like to come with you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
That's right.
I have the gun.
Th --
NOT THAT ONE?!
Fuck!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Different tables.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
She's never coming out.
And we're never getting in.
'Bout four o'clock.
Can we come in?
Huh?
Could the child please stop that?
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
The crowd goes wild.
What?!
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Chills?
"Get the fuck out of my house."
Are you freaking out?
Morse code?
What are you doing?
What if I spazz out?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
You know it. Stay Black...
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Are you finished?
Rodgers... this is no good...
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Yes sir I was.
Yes sir, I did.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
I don't know.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
If you got something to say, say it.
Fuck is up?!
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
What?
Yeah... cop hit me...
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
When?
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
You call that a compliment?
That would be nice.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
I know him well enough?
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
Is that so?
What?
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
I don't care.  I hate him.
I stand corrected.
It's Mister Marion.
Thirteen years...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
How far away?
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait.  He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
Put those away.
Father... I killed those men...
It's gorgeous!
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
You need a glass?
What were you listening to?
You folks ready to go on?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
What say, Louis?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You keep saying that.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Wouldn't wash?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Elizabeth goes free!
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
No, I really think I do.
There's ... another exit?
Man overboard!
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
What?
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
Why would my father send this to me?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
You?!
Me!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
No.
Where does it make berth?
Why ask me?
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
That's not true.
What happened here?
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
You can't mean that.
No, thank you.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
What did you use?
She says it's not.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Considering what?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Aaabout...?
Well, you got another problem.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Yes?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I could go with you.
That's going to fit me?
What in the...?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
I could have you fired right now.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Will you step into the library?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
I'm not going!
I see.
You're acting like a child.
Mother!
Is that so?
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah?
Yeah - go on.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Yes, sir.
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
No!
How do you like your bath, sir?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
That's a canary, sir.
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
My error.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Some bicarbonate - quick!
With pleasure, Madame!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
The name is Smythe.
Yes, sir.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Well, sir, I putter.
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
Can I ask you a question?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
No she's not.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
What's the matter?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Did you do this?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
It's like the basketball team.
You're not allowed to lie.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Play along?
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Those are my friends.
What?
What were you doing in a library?
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
So what's the point?
I just don't think we have the right to ...
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Can I ask you a question?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Hi.
How?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
... Like Prince Charming.
Yeah ...
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
EXCUSE ME?
Bud?
I'm so glad you're here.
Bud ...
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
I'll never be able to do that.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Yeah but what are you doing?
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Are you gonna do it?
What?
Hey. What are you doing?
Hello, this is Back.
Do you like porno movies?
...just talking to you....
...yeah.....
Not very late.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Are you telling me no?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hello?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I don't know.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Oh My God.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
Alright?
Who is it?
How long have you known her?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
This is Lena.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Where you married?
Yeah......yeah.....
Did you have my home phone number?
No.
No.
Hello, how are you?
Can I ask how much is this?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
That's that.
What's up?
Mhm.
It's alright.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
You have another house somewhere or something?
I know.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Seriously.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Put him through.
Are you sure?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
Madeleine --
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
Good day, Marquis.
-- water! --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Go to hell!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
Oh. That.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
And my own.
Poorly.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
Quickly, my suckling, out of your clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it terribly erotic?
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
You've come to lecture me?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Leave at once --
I wonder sometimes.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Who are you, sir?
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.

Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
There. That's right.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
There is nothing to discuss-
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I don't want you to--
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Hearst?
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Showing life
We find the man and then we dissect him-
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Who the hell's Manolete?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Don't do this
Why her?
They don't have to.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Jesus Christ --
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
It's too late. The movie's made
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.

"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
For the title
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I know what you want but it can't be done!
About what?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
And where you goin'?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Yeah, she's nice.
Say what you're gonna say.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Stick out your hands, Jake.
I did keep an eye...
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Whadda ya mean?
Nine o'clock.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
No.
Jake...
But, Jake, I was just...
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
I'm not interested in him.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
What did I do?
All I did...
What's the matter with you?
I called. You weren't there.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Hey, leave the kids alone.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
This is Doyle's house.
He has it. Thank you.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
I'll bet it's been done.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Who said they left then?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
You think he's getting out of here?
Jewelry?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Where'd they take Lisa?
Congratulations, Jeff.
Where?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Something wrong?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Hello.
I don't know what you mean.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
We've progressed emotionally in --
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
What about this morning? Any developments?
Thank heaven that's over!
Would four of them -- ?
What about the rest?
Yes.
Empty as a football.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
I wish there was one I wanted.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
So do I.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Nothing, thank heaven.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Something on your mind, Lisa?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Nobody chickened.
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Any other entrance?
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You don't?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
You remember me?
I'm here.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
Hey where'd you go?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Man, you're schizoid!
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Why?
I shot at one of them.
Good Lord!
No.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Who lives?
You going there?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I'm getting that way, too.
I felt like it.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What?
No!
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
She's being called for.
You said you'd call my father.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
You forget where I work?
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
Nick, please, it's me --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
So does it look a lot different?
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You saved me.
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
Nick, what are you talking about?
Yes!
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
A station wagon in Canada.
I don't know.
Hell. Ten?
What?
Nnn... nothing...
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No, you're not.
No gun.
Take 'em.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
Hot chocolate.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
She's using a new perfume.
GUARD!!!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
She set them up. All of them.
Do what?
POP! That was My card!
I'm ninety-two years old --
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
That I should've picked you up?
You fuckin' wish.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Pam Grier.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
What for?
Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Just hold on buddy boy.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
What's the cut, poppa?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't believe in it.
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
I'm okay.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Dead.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Where?
I got 'em, all right?
That was the plan, we meet here.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
So, is he dead or what?
We can't take him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
I don't know anybody.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Of course.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
You takin' his side?
I told ya he'd be pissed.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Who shot who?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
Look of things, she doesn't.
And one of 'em is sick.
What's the matter with her?
This must have been in the family a long time.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Our kind of women?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
There's a nice boy.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
He knows his alphabet.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
Maybe it's better that way.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
So did I. They were in it.
That's right.
Yes.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
I don't care what she asked you.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Half of them are mine.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
You're not bein' quite fair.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
They shouldn't have done that.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
Maybe I better start working on him.
What's the use.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
Why, yes. They're all I need...
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Maybe I could start you out.
And that's tough, isn't it?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
Hey, Brenda.
That's it.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
It's coming!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
So, I guess I can go now.
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Where the hell are we?
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
Are you okay?
So, whatever happened to her?
How about these buns?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Yes, we made it!
We? What do you mean... we?
Got a problem with that?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Right. What about condoms?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
That's why we came here, remember?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
She's right. We should stick together.
Thanks, handyman.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
What happened?
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Carl's a jerk!
But Mom, the video's not over.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
You mean for TV or print?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
That's nice.
Shhhh..
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
You got your wish.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I did her hair.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
Weren't you afraid?
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
But you have treated me that way.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
 What have you done about Irving August?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
She'll have to know some time.
You'll be all right?
I have been at the library.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
I don't know.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Uh—huh.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
I was a great dancer...
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing —-with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Because I have something very important to do.
Do you have other things?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Oh, uh-huh.
Nine years?
I feel like they do.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
So what about kids?
My therapist said that --
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Of course not.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Ann. Hello.
Are you in the middle of something?
You went out with her?
No.
I'm sorry this came up.
You know?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I have money.
Tell me your name.
Sometimes. Afterward.
Is he going to see this?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
I guess not.
About who?
So you have had sex.
Yes.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
And you feel the same way with John?
Interesting analogy.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But I don't understand --
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
Why not?
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Always the lawyer.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
I have thought about it, yes.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
No, I haven't.
What visitor?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Let me talk to him first.
Will you stop? Jesus.
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
Why not?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
What kinds of questions?
Did he touch you?
I can't believe you did that!!
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Who are you?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
Why don't you let me tape you?
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Hello.
Okay.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
So make an exception.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
I know. Will you please leave now?
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
So is my wife, asshole!!
IBM.
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
You knew these people?
Kiss, kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Gonna cut me open?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
That you, Rog?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Huh?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
You got it!
When do I get to see Brad?
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
We love you, Baby.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
So what's up?
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
How's the trip?
And?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
What are you pouring tonight?
What do you think?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
What happened to you guys?
I can explain.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
You said you had it all lined up.
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
That's what you do with every one.
So you're going to stop acting?
It does. Feels right.
Perfect.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
How do you know?
So what should I wear?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Count me out.
What'd Christine say?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Can you give me some room here?
Huh.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Slaughterhouse.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
Well?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
She tell you she was married?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Look at this!
You broke some.
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
She got anything good?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
You got kids?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
What about me?
Okay. See you around.
About two-thirty.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
About a year.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
It makes me feel better.
...I will.
Just make noises then.
I cursed.
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
What are you doing?
I can feel air.
Oh.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Bimboo?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
And three weeks.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
What book!
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
That's why they got you in jail?
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Gotta go.
More than enough.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
I expect.
He is that.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
All I did was kiss the girl.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
This is a lot of money.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
Stella.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
What makes you say that?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
I wouldn't worry about that.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Where is she?
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Hello, Hal.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
You want me to call Security?
Not like this --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
"Straw God" changed my life.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She still with Kent?
You know, I... don't know.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
About you and mom?
I could get the death penalty.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
The background is.
-- I bet you have.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Maybe he's talking to himself.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Yes.
But that's Simone's part.
What if it catches on fire?
Good morning, Simone.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Wow. They called you their son.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Congratulations.
How do you draw now?
Yes?
I don't know.
Yes, I am.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
They're right here.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Communicate?
Cole, you're scaring me.
They?
What?
Like what?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Witch.
Come on --
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
Never heard of it.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
He started it.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Name something.
What's wrong?
Suzie... No.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
And that makes you look like a squid?
Starla, it ain't --
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Where are you?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Shelby --
Hey there, Chief.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
All the rib eyes?
Welcome home.
Praise Jesus.
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Well?...
Seriously?!?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
How do you know?
I'm proud of you.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Well, thanks for the lift.
What can I say?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Go.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
Shut up, Fred.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Yeah.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
No, what did you say on the machine?
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
-- will be handled back in --
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Shoot.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What else did Padiche say?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
Listen --
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Yes.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
What will you say?
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Just get him to stop.
What are they?
Rheya...
And tonight?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
What happened to us, exactly?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
What does Snow think you should do?
Yes.  Yes.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
What's happening to us?
I love you.
Rheya --
I never said I didn't.
Yes, you are --
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Where did you go before?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
He won't do it.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Followed by non-human manifestations.
You want it coming back with us?
Claire!
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Looks a little constipated to me.
I'm supposed to call in.
Beg pardon?
Let's get a drink.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.  It was.
What about Neil?
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Good night, Mike.
Open the door, will you?
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Yeah.
They called here after you left...
You don't want to know.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Keep what handy?
Mike?
So how'd it go?
I can still use a gun.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Who's Joey Venza?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
You should'a brought the girl.
Let my kid go.
Okay, I guess.
You coming in?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Are you okay?
How are you doing, kid?
Yeah--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
You're making my life difficult.
Thanks, I already ate.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
He knew.
What if you get hurt?
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Sit down and stop being such a child.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Strong...
I... I like you.  A lot.
Waldos.
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
You sure about all this?
Yeah, Roz.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
I'll introduce you.
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Aunt May, what happened?
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
No…
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Jawohl.
Coming up.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Have a cigar.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
It is.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
You're teasing me again!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
You'll fix me up!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Hey, Animal! Animal!
Betty! Betty!
You want to go?
Anything else?
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
How do they know?
Who did?
You taking Dunbar?
Thirty-fifth.
What time?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Which one of us is the informer?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
Where is he now?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
We're within range, sir.
Why would you want to leave?
I don't understand.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Yes.  Thank you.
I thought you might.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
Well, now that we're all aboard=8A  Number One, bring the ship before the wind.  Let's see what's out there.
Maybe they're not out there.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Shall I alert Dr. McCoy?
Calm yourself, Bones.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
My readings indicate great instability.
Later. Let's go...
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
... How long?
I'll go...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott?
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
See! That shimmering area.
Close... There --
Would you look at that?
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
David?... David!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... The needs of the few...
What must I do?
What you ask is difficult.
Sir, may I suggest --
500 Kellicams!
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Now that's what I call a meal.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
Wait --
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
Don't tell me you've got something.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Time's up, Admiral...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
On screen.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Affirmative, Admiral.
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
In my quarters, Uhura.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Prepare for warp speed.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Certainly...
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
It'll come back to him.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
... You're very perceptive.
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Thanks. Cheers.
What's what?
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
So. There we are.
But Kirk...
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Permission granted.
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
In progress, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
Surely you can be more specific...
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Why not?
The hell I can't
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
Status?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
Don't panic...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Sometimes I do.
Can he breathe under water?
The artificial lifeform was right?
And our people?
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Implants bothering you?
Full impulse.
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Worf to Picard...
No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back...
Why was Data assigned?
Come in.  Hi.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It's Cochrane.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
I do not know what you are referring to.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
ATR setting...
Yes.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
"Money." So you can get dome money...
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Why?
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Good luck, sir.
Agreed. Options?
Someone...?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
We're not finished.
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
He's a DOCTOR!
And what did they tell you?
That isn't true...!
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
They're preparing to fire.
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
How much time's left of your sentence?
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Stand down your weapons.
Aft thrusters -
Just the prototype.
Surely not.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
But I am not human. I am only -
Close enough to beam down?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
How did you - ?
What?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
You having hearing problems, mister?
What is it?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Brother. I cannot move.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Indefinitely.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Remember him?
Is he very much like you were?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
A bit less florid, Data.
Yes, sir.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Counselor.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
No.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Sir?
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Sir, we're being hailed.
Understood.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, we're being hailed.
What's this?
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
It's working.
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
We need to talk, just you and I.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Were we always explorers?
Looking up at the stars.
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
After you, Praetor.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
In time, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Report!
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
My God...
How long until we reach the Rift?
What?!
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Praetor.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
I don't think so... 
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
No.
Elmo's...
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
When can we expect containment?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Good.
What?
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
I...
What's the matter?
I do not understand.
I need you.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Yes?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I understand.
Are you my friend?
I do not want to.
That was beautiful.
Put that back.
On the radio they say it's good.
Are you angry at me?
I will go. But not you.
You promised.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
Slow down, slow down.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Oh, Jesus.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Where are you going?
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
That's not sayin' much.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He records himself raping and killing her--
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So've I.  Too much.
He's been cooked-off
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
Where's Faith?
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
What clip?  What was it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
What the fuck are you doing?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
That's where it gets a little strange.
Whatup Lenny?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Testa?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Agent Mackelway.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Dylan here.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Look, mister...
How did you know he was a construction worker?
At the field office.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Jesus.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
What happened?
Unlock these cuffs.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Yes.
What was your weakness, sir?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Was it Zero?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Thomas Mackelway.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
No.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Well, thank you...?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Why? You're not a real man?
How was it hard?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
...then ask where you met her...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Well, I should be getting...
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
It's definitely a step back for me.
What do you want? You're tall.
What'd you get?
Oh.  Where is this place?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Uuuuugh!
They turned you down?
You miss the pain?
It's kinda money, actually.
Make someone bleed.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
That's right.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
We're going to Vegas.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Vegas, baby!
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
You gotta do it.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
What an asshole.
That was so demeaning...
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
That's bullshit.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
Baby, you did fine.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Oh... a Dorothy.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
What time's this party tonight?
Which one?
You looked right at her, baby.
I'm sorry.
Was I money?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
That was pretty cold, dude.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Anaheim...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
Godfather.
You heard about your father?
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
You take care of Paulie?
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
Good for ten men...
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Yes.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
I'm going to finish school.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Yes.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Godfather, you understand everything.
I know.
That's for you to find out.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Was there a definite proposal?
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
How will they come at you?
You know I love spaghetti.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Al Capone!
How do you do.
I'm thinking about it.
Hello.  Kay?
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so either.  I better go.
When will I see you again?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Until the old man tells me different.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Just be patient.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Thanks.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You think I scam?
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
We?
Who's this?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I love jazz.
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
I have to go to Venice.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
No!
What does he say?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
Really? To Italy?
Frederico!
Hello?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Hardly.
Yes it is.
Tom.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Dickie!
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Is this you?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
As in the...?
Randall.
What?
So -- are you travelling under R?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
My God.
What rumour?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Are you okay?
How was it?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
What about Thomas Ripley?
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
November, I thought.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
The singer?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
What about the record?
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is it? I'm busy.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
I have.
You carry a piece? You need one?
You looking for some action?
What's your name?
What's your real name?
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
Why should it be grounded?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes I am.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I can't sleep nights.
You moonlightin?
Is that so?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Anything you say, officer.
So howsit?
Yeah.
Could we change the subject?
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
I'm not a fool, Billy.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
What about you, Delly?
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
You look... different.
And why not?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Well, there's got to be a way...
I don't smoke?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Yes.
Yes... yes, I do.
No, sir.
I'm not refuting anything.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Who... are they?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Yes?
Ha!
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Jesus.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Not at all.
I taught you that.
Is there a young Tim?
That's my r-r-rent.
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
That you got let go.
Yes.  Very.
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
San Francisco.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Yes, I did.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Why, it's just like air, isn't it?  When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
Good morning.
Yep.
Yes?
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Are you sure?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Yes.
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Mother?
Well... well, is everyone all right?
I got them all, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Oh, my God, look at her!
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I started to say... inside...
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Does this room look silly?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Ahhh, but I know you.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I didn't break that window!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
Yes.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Can't see a thing.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Why did he shoot her?
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
What do you do?
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
It was like that yesterday.
Melanie, Melanie...
Have you got a pencil?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Scotch, light on the water.
We need them.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
I'm leaving! Are you coming?
I fear he may have to.
Ask this one favor --
You must leave this house.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Aye.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
But you did promise.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
You've no thought of going there?
It was a woman when we put her in.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
A doctor?
I will not have you use that name to me.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I've had some experience.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I would make you rich.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
You and I should work together.
Burke them?
Nearly a year.
How long ago?
But can anything be done for her?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
She would if she could.
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
What did they give you?
How can you die if you're already dead?
How do you know?
No! Why are you haunting me?
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Look, can I just call a cab?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Please. Come inside.
I leave that in your hands.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Where is that?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
No foolin'? Will you?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
You must have come a long way.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I wonder if we ought to--
What about him?
How do you know?
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Oh -- hello--
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
Where are you going now?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
All together?
Should I run him through?
Maximum body-count.
We still going?
What?...
Where is she?!
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's not glowing.
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
What's that smell!?
What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Whatcha doin' over here?
Are we havin' fun or what?
Who, Laddie?
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Tell them to get something to eat.
You've heard this story before?
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Ouch.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
When?
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
You've got to put this on.
You're beautiful.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Was dark... find a light...
MacReady!
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What?
Then I'll have to kill you.
We should have jumped his ass.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
How far's that?
Don't let up, Childs!
What if it doesn't come?
What is it?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Get back!!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
And everyone looks like us?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
Where?
What are you?
We need your help.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Yes.
Alexander.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
And why not?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Got here as soon as I could.
Admiration?  My my.
A moonstone.
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
I know that --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
I can see Kalen's point.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Someone you loved very much.
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
I see.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Why?
You know that's not true.
You won't even try?
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
You ok?
Should we be...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
In where?
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What for?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
I gave you my dog tags.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
Yes.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
You think Lorenson kills you?
How long do we have?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
How you doin'?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You have no idea what's going on.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Why don't you help me?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I did?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Who told you this?
Don't you go to jail for that?
What were you talking about the other day?
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
You don't think that's crazy?
How?
Have a good day at work today.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
What's wrong?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Call me back.
Hey, peaches.
Hello...
It's nothin' like that.
Yes.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
Get the car.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
She thinks he's a pig.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
What happened to your hair?
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Holy shit.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Thelma.
Yeah.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
What?
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
It'd have to be pretty good.
What in the hell is that up there?
Go.
No, I just meant...
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Well... at least now you know.
Never met him.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Who?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Thanks.
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
By the way, what's your name?
I already know it, Mary.
I work with retards.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
A surprise?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
That...? Vestibule.
Fuck!!
Uh-huh.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
I don't buy it.
Huh?
Three different guys?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
How many is that?
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
You little fuck.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Bundt cake?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
What's up?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Oh, are you on the team?
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
You look great.
Hm?
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
So what's up?
Starshells.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Well, I'm not.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
My father --
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Yes it is.
John. How much time?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Still heading for Cuba.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Mr. Clear Moon.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
A murder. On the reservation.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
What journey?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Who is he?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Alright. Alright...
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
What's he smoke in that?
What did he say?
Why should I tell you.
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Ray --
What'd you expect to hear?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
Go ahead, Ray.
Ray...
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
I beg your pardon.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
What are you talking about?
It dies. We live.
You don't have to kill it.
Does it bother you?
This is it, then.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
What do you do when you come here?
How do you play reality.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Goose is dead.
Well?
Yes sir.
F-14's sir.
He better be kidding!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
280, 290, 300 knots.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
How was it?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
GET LOST!
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
Figured it out yet?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
I lost.
For the same reason you are.
Goose is dead.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
You may not think so, but you are.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Welcome to Mars.
The Last Resort.
Why not?
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
Yes, sir.
What is it?
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
I'm listening.
Amazing.  Where are we?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
I don't know.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Rekall?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Well...What do you say?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
And falling in love?
I didn't know you were so kinky.
I suppose you're not here either.
I love you.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
She wasn't really my wife.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
He's lying.
You sure about this?
What?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
She's got my vote.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
We're not going over there, right?
Howdy, Rhonda.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
We'll take your word for it.
Don't he have a home to go to?
You go north, I'll go south.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Its tires are flat...
Watch your ass, shithead.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Darn it!
Ms. Vin's sister.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
I noticed.
"We"?
No it's not the only issue. There's another issue, for the jury. What about entrapment?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Not at all --
We have a full caseload, Rog.
-- a speed manufacturer --
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
But what?
Let's get a cab.
You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
-- What?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Murder witness.
You do.
Afraid of what?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
That's right.
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
Blonde.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Where were you for the last hour? I've been lookin' for you?
What was?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Was there an argument?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Where's Hap?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
No.
Ever see her with someone else?
How come Jack let's you work here?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Shorthand. Really?
Oh, the uncle is missing.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Noooo...
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Where are you going?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
What can I tell you?
The pages are gone. That's real.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
Right on time, baby.
James...
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You want to see...
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Are you sure you're okay?
Leland...
Bobby didn't give you this?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
When's the next business trip, big fella?
I don't know.
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
Abrams...
Very good.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
I do. Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
No.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Objection, we've...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
Dr. Thompson...?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I am on the staff of...
'Code Blue'...
I. Yes. It is.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Dr. Gruber...
I understand.
You live in the neighborhood?
Mrs...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I did.
Nothing further, your Honor...
The TV didn't work.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
What...?
Why don't you get some rest?
And it's over...?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Is it over?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
This is Miss Costello...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
...fifty thousand dollars?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
What do you want?
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
So what?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
I'm swell.
That's right.
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
What are you doing in New York...?
In New York?
What?
...of the procedures...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
How'm I doing so far?
Hurry up!  Jump in!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
That needle ain't pointing north!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
So is the town, I notice!
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
We will, sir!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
Can I read it?
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
So?
Heather?
Yes.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You going away?
Who?
He's on his way.
In my bed.
Home.
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Dylan, where's the man?
Really?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
What's that?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Dylan.  And...  Chase.  My God, Wes, did you know?
Uh...sure...when?
What?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Make us proud.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Albatross?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
I just can't believe it.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Why'd you do it?
But that's not the point...
Do you have your ticket?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
Is that what you were trained to do?
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
You're officer of the watch, George.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
Don't ever call me stupid.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
Well, that was neighborly.
What's it going to be?
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
And you didn't do anything about it?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
This your car?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
What's she doin' here?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
What'd you say?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
What?
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
You okay, honey?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What's that honey?
Yeah?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What'd you say to her?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Yeah.
More'n likely.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Lula, you there?
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
That you, Sail, honey?
You find any work?
You sick?
Anything I can do for you?
Love you, too.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Six.
Wouldn't make any difference.
What if I told you not to?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot him.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
You heard right.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
You snore.
So I hear.
It's the Chancellor.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
Who the hell is that?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
You cold, James?
That's really it.
I had to. Didn't I?
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
So where have you been staying?
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Colon cancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Maybe she didn't come here.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
Because of my coat?
But, last night...
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
So what are you going to do?
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
I heard.
Really? That was fast.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Oh?
Would Walter really press charges?
I think I might have.
I lost it all.
I know.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
What is it, Grady?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Where you stand?
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
You doing okay?
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
Something wrong with that?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Then what? What?!
Next week? The week after?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
It's not what you think.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
I could get a search warrant.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I was asleep.
I have a passionate girlfriend.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
And your new apartment?
Walter.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
I know because... it's just something I know.
You should go home.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
A diary?
That's right.
Ev-i-dence.
Reflect.
No fucking way.
I'm still thinking about it.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You couldn't say.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.
What is your idea of being a Jew?
You don't know!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Who do you see?
Where?
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
What the hell are you doing there?
This is garbage!
Did you get an erection?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Are you?
What about bears?
So, you're not a dyke.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
I'm sorry, Walter.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
I've changed.
Their power. They seduce me.
Nothing. It's over.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
I'm not scared.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
You got it?!  You got it?
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
You never did like being called that, did you?
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Jesus, Lindsey--
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Virgil?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
You better not say you missed that.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
Would we see the flash?
Then how come you're not with him?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
Shall we go for a swim?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Then why do you say them?
Claudia, let's get married?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
And do you remember where she got off?
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
They didn't seem too good.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
I can't say.
One of the other Sisters?
Because I'm getting fat.
I'm a blimp.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Who tells you these things?
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Of God.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
What do you mean?
Who?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Often?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
How were you sick?
And what happened?
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Martha Louise Livingston.
Would you like to be?
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
What things?
Somebody told her.
Who?
Do you believe she really saw them?
I could never be a mother.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
What the child?
She can't hurt you any more.
And that you're stupid?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Her headaches.
I'm afraid.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
And then what happened?
Someone's following me.
Yes.
I don't know which one 
Who?
Why?
Who?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Are you frightened?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Thanks. 
No, no, no...
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
You can call me Sister.
No-one.
How did she hide it during the day?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Why do you think that?
That's absurd!
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
Then help her.
I am...
How?
Earthquakes?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Sister Paul?
You lied to me
Your niece!
Her spiritual health.
Bullshit!
And what has that to do with it?
Even Christ would partake socially.
Do you think they ever existed?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
That's what I have to believe...
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Where is she?
Who knew she was pregnant?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
They are?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah.
What about all these letters?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
Have I said something amiss?
He hasn't.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Sorry.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Are you supposed to be here?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Is it ... is it, really?
Something like that.
Gear?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Where are you off to?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Like what?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Hello.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
It'll only get you into trouble.
Oh, leave off!!!
What do you think are you're up to?
What?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
I'll set John on you!
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
... I don't know...
What's the terrain down there?
Then take her down.
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
I'll go first.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Yes!
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
We're not going anywhere.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
It's stopped?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Can we get to him?
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Let's hear it.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Let's get back and call this in.
Thanks.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Where is she?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
It's too late!
Oh, man...
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What?
Is it still moving?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
And...?
That's what we thought.
They've changed their heading again.
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Seltzer?
Yeah.  Somebody won.
So, what do you think?
What?
What can I do?
You have to...
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
How do you know my name?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
Please do.
Just like that, eh?
Just like that.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Paved with what, then?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
I'm in love with Lloyd!
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What have you got to do with it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
That's not true!
Because I don't want to.
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Margo.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
I take it she read well.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Huh?
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
I'll try.
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Many happy returns of the day...
Need any help?
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
What fire and music?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
What a body, what a voice.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I'll say.
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
Why?
Why.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
So few come back...
So am I.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Kill the people.  Got your key?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Oh-oh.
Birdie-
No.
Now you want an argument.
She works hard.
You probably won't believe me.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
Not at all.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
He's the best.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hollywood.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
She knows enough not to be here.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
No, don't go...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
If you'd like.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
It's the tight girdle that does it.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
She's just outside the door.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
It doesn't matter.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Margo, again...
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
What is?
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
With gestures, of course.
What's so funny?
Twentyish. It isn't important.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
You'd have been proud of her.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
I never said it was!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Yes, sir.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
What's your being married got to do with it?
But what could she do?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I didn't hear you.
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
--no way--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
Hey?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
July of '71.
--see?--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Anything you've got.
Sure.
You want me to be the bastard.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
I'm so glad.
Can't help you.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
There's always a later plane.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
The ones who could disburse the money.
So tell me about the Times article.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
Just tell me his title.
I got Clawsen on hold--
--I'm sure--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
To where?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
Mitchell knew then.
Haldeman too?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
Are you sure?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
You can't believe that.
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
--has any of them got an ax?--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--no--
Does "they" mean the White House?
When so ordered.
Great evening, isn't it?
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
This is your plan, Finch?
What are we gonna hear?
Just go!
What's your middle name?
What?!
I wasn't making fun of you.
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Then what the hell are you talking about?
There's our man.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
You can send me the address too.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
I know, Dad.
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Yes.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Don't you want me to?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
This was remade?  Into what?
What's up, fellas?
You've got something going?
You did it.
Well...uh...
Uh...
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I think "shithead" really says it.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Me too.
I want to hear you say it.
What?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Feeling better, Oz?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Really?
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
The key is don't look down.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Ha-ha!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
What makes you so sure this will work?
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
What...?
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
Whoa...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Another step and he's dead!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Andy? Andy is that you?
Claude.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Andy!
Merde.
Why were you so late tonight
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Who did you hear it from?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Who's Sophie?
No! I look ridiculous!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Come on up!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
What a beautiful ship!
Dmitri didn't want the money?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
You're a princess...
See? The Princess is under there ...
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
How can you possibly oversleep?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Don't give it to me. Don't!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Yeah, I know.
Duane?
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
it's my first time.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
M'hm.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
You don't want me to live with you?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
M'hm.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
and I keep, you know, it's-
Will it change your wife?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Oooh.
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Here's a real present.
yes, we had, uh...
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Christ!
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
What?
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You look very pretty.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Why are you so hostile?
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Commentary.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
I can think of another word.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Yeah.
Probably on their first date, right?
Hey.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Ah.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Well, hi!
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
So who won?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
Absolutely.
Absolutely not.
It has your ring.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Leo?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
Not this time.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
What is that thing?
He's gonna miss his flight.
It's not a contest.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Anymore.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Sally?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Cal, my wife Judy.
He's directing now.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
We'll be fine.
Did he promise?
Accept a compliment.
Through the sweats or not?
We're great.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
What are you saying?
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I don't want to go tonight.
Oh, you know, I am.
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
Yes.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't be silly.
Do I put you off?
Ah.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
What am I, five?
Well, yes, actually.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
I'm sorry.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Oh?
Do Peter Sellers again.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Are you asking me to marry you?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Shit!
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
We're going to have to go back out there.
I trust you.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Are you asking me out to dinner?
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Want a list?
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Of course not --
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
...Not enough food?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Why are we so successful?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Sheldrake?
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Twenty-seven.
I hope everything goes all right.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Good night.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
What gave you that idea?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
One more?
You all right? What's the matter?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
What is it?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Your phone.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Someone from the office.
Something wrong with your legs?
No -- it's my stomach.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
You are?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Do I have to?
Sure.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
I guess so.
I'm fine all over.
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
You do?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
You left your wife?
You like?  It's all yours.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
You?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
How many pills were in that bottle?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Help yourself.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Who is Mickey?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
No.
Good night?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Please -- just let me sleep.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I want you back, Fran.
That's enough, Fran.
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Baxter?
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
My men --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Get out --
We've been attacked.
Moonby what?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
North ?
Rangers, eh?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A long time.
So what happened ?
Cook school -- that did it.
What do you see?
Probably is.
Looks that way.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
What're you trying to say, Captain --
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
They're not Cong.
Who knows? Right.
I never heard about that.
You didn't like him.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Spooky.
What -- happened here.
Yeah.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Captain?
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Fucking savages.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
No -- no, sir.
Yeah, I like it...
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
I can handle it.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
I had immense plans.
And you admired him?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
What?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
You're Australian?
I should be checking on the boat.
What's a big question?
Yes.
I don't know anything about these papers, sir.
Where's your chief supply officer?
134  CONTINUED:
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
...I won't let a killer walk!
39   CONTINUED:
Where'd you say Eric is?
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Be careful, okay?
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
New to the country, kid?
Been driving long?
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Have to get these wet things off.
How many do you see?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
You hear me?  Ben?
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Have they done blood tests on him?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Spencer.
Okay.
Carol the waitress?
I'm not kidding.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
You take off when you have to.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
You wanna dance?
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
It's one idea...
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
What do you want?
What a break...
I've got to sketch you.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
How's Verdell doing?
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
About a dog.
Sure thing.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Do you realize that I work at him?
No, I didn't.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Now we'll both call him.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
You consider your life easy.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
What restaurant?
Tachlinkov.
No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
You would be.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
Who?
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
What?
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Yeah.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Ten million --
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Nikita?
What does that mean?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Right.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
More or less.
Why?
Because you are a women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Thinking.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
No.
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Do you think he's here?
Transmits and receives.
Check.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
Yes.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
They're worth less points.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Thank you.
Why?
Can I ask you something?
It happened to you before?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Why are you working today?
You're very good at this aren't you?
For what?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
I hope not.
Right.
Why didn't you fade?
This will take some time.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
How to make a buck!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
That stinks!
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
So?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Chris! Tell me some good news.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Yeah, Dave Walters.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
I've been around.
Sure. Excellent.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No.
Forget about me Kat.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
They'll do it.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
You mean it's started?
We don't need you.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Yeah, but it was okay.
It's Josh's.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
When the hell did you write that?
What for?
That's my bag.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Why are there still such headlines?
You are quite sure it's secure?
So, who is in the building?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
I'm sorry about how we --
I don't want his money.
I could take after Dad, too.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
I'm thinking.
Deranged.
I don't want to have any conversation.
'Is it really me?'
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Like you'd know.
Saturn. Beautiful.
The play's going to be really good.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
What?
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
What would you do up here?
I've talked to your father.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
How're you doing?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
No.
I'm asking how much.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
Your parents are divorced?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
I'd do that --
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
You came here to give me my report card?
So what did we just make?
A similar triangle?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
I beg your pardon?
Hot tip,  Rubber Biscuit in the third race at Arlington.
Learn anything?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
How are you?
Dad, you seen the drill?
The sunrise? What for?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Marty, that would alter history.
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
How did you know?
What do you call this? 
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Yeah.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Oh yeah?
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
What're you doing?
No, you're not either.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
There you go.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
How bad off is he?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Everybody loves trout.
It was going too fast.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Just thinking.
Maybe.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
You okay?
Dead.  Damnit!
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Was she pretty?
The girl I remind you of.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
It's too dangerous.
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
...Who?
Yeah, he's funny that way.
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
I beg your pardon?
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
A souse!
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Howdy, neighbor.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...This must be boring you.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...Yeah, okay.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
How did you know about that?
You're leaving?
What do you mean?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on –
Hold on –
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's more than I've got.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Fink.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
...Those your only bags?
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Home. Watching TV.
All night?
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
I need a cigarette.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
I don't smoke.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
No.
There's a name from the past.
She wiped out her whole family.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Why not?
What did you pay Nilsen?
You shouldn't play this game.
I don't know.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
Really.  What are you writing about.
You workin' on another book?
He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
Nilsen?
What kind of talk?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
Maybe the maid did it.
What was the motive?
So what do we do -- nothing?
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
I don't know.
The whole thing – painting.
New York.
Ignorant art?
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Is Jean Michel here?
These are great.
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
You're not?
Not what?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Really?
Out?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry – fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Good. What do you have?
Drugs??!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I'm your family.
I hadn't thought about it.
What's that?
How is he?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
See you later.
Wanna Mac?
I don't eat junk food.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
I'll make you another one.
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Where's the fire?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
What're you really after?
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Son!
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
What is it?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Crimefighter's rule number two.
I'm afraid to ask.
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
I wouldn't bet on that.
That's gotta hurt.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I find that unlikely.
What say we turn up the heat?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
I don't know, sir. Your dear parents.  Suddenly gone. So much loss...
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Recognition, of course.
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
You are direct, aren't you?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
La'chiem.
Slanta.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
...Not the bat?
What?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
I'll show you it works.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Yes?
Take me. Let the boy go.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
GET IN THE CAR!!
I'll have to ask you for that film.
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
How'd you find this place?
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
What are you talking about?
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
I understand.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
Here, let me do that.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
Bye, Dad.
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Of course he is.
No it wasn't!
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-dumpling...
Bunghole...
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
...Two...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Ah, the witness?
You see what I see, Bork?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Chief, look!
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
What?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Here's something.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Three times.  Powerful number.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
He might have hurt somebody.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We were trying to scare your mother.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
No.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
I want to get in.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
You've got to help them.
W... What is it?
Otho'll know what to do.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Are they suffering?
Any particular kind?
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
You don't have a key?
Maybe Charles does.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hellooo!  How's school?
You can pull your trousers up, now.
... Straight out?
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
No, Robert.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
A Black man gave me the message.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
May I ask your name?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Hello, Sid.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you like it?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Oh, good.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
I agree.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
No, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes.
Hello, Ronald.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Yes.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
Yes. I've seen that done.
You're welcome.
Yes. That is surprising.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Since you were a child?
Come now, Mr. Chance.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
Sid, it's useless!
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
No, that won't do any good.
This is not what I requested.
Oh? What?
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Malkovich.
Who am I thinking of?
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Is the trial date set?
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
The ferret?
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What about Maxine?
Tell her you need to see her.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You came up here looking for the portal?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Yes?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
No.
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
Who told you?
Just.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
I've fallen in love.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Two hundred dollars, please.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Thank you, Floris.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
When?
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
How do we do that?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
You still there, sweets?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Bad dream, darling?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Good-bye, Maxine.
Well?
That's the last thing they took from me.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
YES.
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mama let me help you.
Out where?
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You planning to do anything about it?
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
I know my rights.
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Yeah.
What tied the room together, Dude?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I was bowling--
They posted the next round of the tournament--
I'm shomer shabbas.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Lebowski on the right?
Yes, heh--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Ahh, not so good, man.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Well--yeah, I guess--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
What happened to your house?
Jeffrey--
What the fuck are you--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Huh.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
The what?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
What about the toe?
Now Dude--
Yeah.
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
And the fucking money!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
Huh?
What the fuck are you talking about?
This driveway.
There weren't any shots.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter Sobchak.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Right, Dude.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well?  Aren't you?
YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
Thank you.
You came back for me.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Where the hell have you been?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
So?
Put it back in park, Blade.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Whistler, I --
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
Is he sick?
I've been better --
I know. Take some of my blood.
Please --
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
Blade --
Who are you people?
Whistler!
How?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Why?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
--how old?
Oak?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Was that you laughing?
No.
Then I'm going--
You have to go.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
The witch?
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
What movies?
What?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Me, too.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Boy Kurth.
How's she going to know where to--
Yeah. Me too.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Asleep--
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Spite.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
What's that?
Still working on it.
I'm sorry.
Domini.
Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
She's far from "fine."
I thought all witches were benign and good.
--yes--
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
Meurice--
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Well... what happened?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
It'll pass.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
Well now you do.
...Just doin' my job.
I want you to go fishing.
...Count it if you want.
That's not the point.
What's the point?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
Where was I?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Jeffrey?
Anything you can tell me?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
No. not at all.
Hello, baby.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Do you like the way I feel?
See my nipples?
You can hit me, if you want to.
You don't?
Then don't talk about killing.
Hi. can I come in?
Who is Don?
I'm doing it.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Yes.
Do you love me?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
I did. are you?
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
On a ride.
Nothing.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Alright.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
. Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. without her sensing anything?
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Okay.
Really?
No.
Good to see you, son.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Can I use the car tonight?
No.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Where do you guys want to count?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
He what?
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Five-thousand per kilo.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Blanca, por favor.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Are you kidding?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Tuna, this is crap.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
No.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Nice doing business with you, George.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
No fucking way.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I just got released five minutes ago.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
George.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
Where do I put this!?
No more brothers, Diego.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
Surprised to see me?
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Layaway shmayaway.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Family.
George, you look terrible.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Dad.
Why are you smiling?
Why are you smiling?
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Not in front of the kid.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I swear.  On my life.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
And you believe the NLF?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Why?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
So -- where do we start?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's what my report will read.
What can we prove?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Sex.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
Six years.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
Then what happened?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
How do you know that?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
Yes.
Yes.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
Yes.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Are you going to represent me?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
How'd you meet Marsh?
Why would she lie?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
I love you.
This is not relaxing.
Can't it wait?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
What's she like?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
It was a place to start.
That's too bad.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
SO!
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Mom's orders.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Well, there's a problem.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
What?
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Not yet. You want to go?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
How long you been married?
Mind if I smoke?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I feel so embarrassed.
Help cook?
She starts sniffing me.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Why, do you think?
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
What?
I told you, I love other people.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Sure.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
I... What do you want?
What do you want me to say?
WHY?
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Where you going?
Hmm?
Betty.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Are you nuts?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
What the hell you talking about?
You think that's really him?
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Wh-wh-whooo?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
What it will be.
How did you get in here?
I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
I lied.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Who?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
What else does she say?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Lucky thing.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Patrick, he's...
We gotta jump!
Listen to me, boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Nice rack.  How old is --
Yeah, you heard of him?
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
You want to get into this now?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
I think you're fucking crazy!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
You can't leave.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Where, then?
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
You betrayed me!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We were in a car accident --
I should be going.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
See?  We're for real.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
I knew it.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
He said you lost something.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I wanted to apologize.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Why?
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Hey.
Yes.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
Forget it.
What do you want to do?
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Are you Treadstone?
We have to go home, Jason.
Right.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
We thought you were gone for good.
Jesus...
I don't know.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I don't remember any of this.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- just --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
You could do that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
It's reply paid.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
You sound worried.
Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Layton! Oh shit!
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
You killed him?
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
Shut up!
Yes.
Where do I get it stamped?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Look at that - right on time.
Will you please turn back.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
I'm going to open it!
What happened to you after ...
Your face ... are you hurt?
A cheque.
Tuttle?
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
You are good to me Sam.
Can I forget it?
What! Shit!
What have you done with his body?
Whatever happened to you?
No need, sir
what? ... Oh ... 
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
What if there is no tomorrow?
She's having a baby. Twins.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
Is this what you gave Mary?
Does that hurt?
You're going to live.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
You never know.
She should go home.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
You married?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Promise you won't go inside.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
Three legs.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Frank!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
You packing up tonight?
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Good night.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
What happened?
Watch? --
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
No.  You know that I'm not.
Let's go...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
So who's the guy?
Ready.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Goodbye, Paul.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
What did he say?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
They're not really going to call security are they?
I wish it were you giving the story.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Ernie, they're calling from work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You okay?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Because you're nuts.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
What?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
Hi.  It's me.
Well, when?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That's yes?
Take it easy.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Where's the bathroom?
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Would you like to do me?
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Oh it's enough...
A girl with a body like mine?
Alright we're clear.
Anything new?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
You really like it?
I know what it is to be ignored.
You think I'm creative?
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter...stay away from me!
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man look at that get up !
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
I didn't mean to.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You know what that proves?
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
How ya doin'?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I saw your...cat.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
Hello Mayolia.
Oh, OK.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
No, we didn't.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
You're even weaker than the others.
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
I didn't expect to see you.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Yes.
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
That is so cool.
Pike.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Nicole...
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Really?
And Spring Fling.
Oh, thank you very much.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
My right nostril?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Switch nostrils?
No, no, it was great.
How 'bout a back rub?
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
We lost.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
It's Skip, for you.
Well I guess this is it.
I got lured.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Ninety-five miles an hour.
What's it say?
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Will that work for me?
Did you call me a cocksucker?
I didn't spit on you!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
I was playing naked.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Crash Davis?
Who you calling a "boy"?
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
Looking for Crash Davis.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Was I at that dinner?
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
Lester...
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
702 472 1862.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
I can't! I'm tied!
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
What?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
All right, Ace?
You think he got the point?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Please...
What people?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
I just told you. She called me.
No, I'm not okay.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Yeah, she's here.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
It's always been our policy -
Certainly.  Senator.
Okay. Just take it easy.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
You all right?
Yeah.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Why do you need that much?
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
And...
I bought him a watch too.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I want you to let me go.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Not gonna let me in?
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
But it was just mine.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...and hypocrisy.
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
No.
No, no? You didn't?
What expenses?
Yeah, that works out.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hi. Good.
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
Come on. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Carmine left?
He's gone?
What?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I understand.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yeah.
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
What about my money?
Get the fuck out of here.
...same outfit.
Thank you. Very nice.
What's the matter?
Get lost?
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
I'm here.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Listen...
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
I took care of everybody.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Hey.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
What's the matter with you?
All right, all right. But I - I -
Yeah.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Guilty. I am.
What did you think?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
She has a real spirit.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
For when the time comes..
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Enough.
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
You turned around!
Nothing. How's your hand?
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Don't you have children?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
What's this?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Can you make him stop!
Nels?
Will you let me explain!
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
What makes you say that?
What about the others?
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
How much time do you have left on it?
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
What bank?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
What's going on?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
No.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Yes.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Do you have to point that?
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
I'm handling it.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't know what you mean.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And not a nickel.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Who's this?
I can see the benefit in that.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
I'm in awe.
Why are you picking on me for?
I already called for an ambulance.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Government business?
Then why doesn't she?
He agreed that he was.
Persistent.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Who's she?
You on the game?
Jesus Christ!
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
He lived here with you?
Maybe.
I think you do.
Did he come here too?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Dil --
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Don't be cruel.
It's her, isn't it?
You promise?
So it's true, then?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Never.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Yes.
Yes. Now.
Will I see you again?
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
Lucky you.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Tough work, that.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You were made for this.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Why do you want to do that for?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Just a girl.
Good. So what do you think?
How is it a farce?
So, what do I look like?
Well, I could say the same about you.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.
Is it bad?
She can't help it.
I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Go to sleep now.
Stop that talk now --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
The teddy bear?
You didn't?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
That fucker's dead --
All right -- where's the letter?
Oh, come on!
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Oh, you should see your face.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
Reggie -- listen to me!
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Only we call them agents.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Were you followed?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
That's the spirit.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
It's Charles!
No.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Bartholomew?
Why you lied to me.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Whitefoot, of course.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
It's a start, anyway.
You mean, you're a thief?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
Forty-five thousand.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
I don't know anything.
Leave?
Swiss.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
But he is gone.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
Oh. I guess.
How do you know?
Of course? I thought he was dead.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
How would you like a spanking?
Peter -- are you all right?
Go on.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
But why do you want a divorce?
Because I don't love him.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
It won't happen again.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
What's wrong?
What did you hear?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Are you sure?
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
You aren't going to the party?
Me? Why me?
You're the killed.
Mark Shale.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Not that many.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
Especially not your dad.
I can't right now.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Why?
I do not.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Sharon's far from a slut.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Yes?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Yeah.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
I got to go.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
You can have both if you want.
No.
Maybe it won't stay in.
What?
If sheep don't count.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?


Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Since when does...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Uh, huh?
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Why don't I--?
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
...truck.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
I got, uh....
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
 Excuse me...
You'd better coast through...
We're clear.
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
...-er.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...

God-...
Shut up.
Oh, shit.
...gun?!
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...I believe in live and...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
 Okay.
Goddamn!
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old...
Come on.
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Shut up!
...ho!
 Go, go.
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
Listen, Arlo...
...-er.  It was your friend...
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...
Huh?
Hey, just shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.

Arlo!  Arlo.
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They'll meet you at the top.
Why'd you stay behind?!

 Well.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
 Yeah.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
No.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
 big balls.
Be cool.  Be--
That was quick.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

And it won't be pleasant. 
Yeah, that's my truck.
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...

Any of them Richard Long?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
"I am become Death, the...
No!
...that.
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
"Went away."  I like that.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
This is it.
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Hit him.
Get your links set up!
We were called in by the Jerome base...
That's right.
...scientists.
I assume you want that to go.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...




...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...he's smart enough to get you...
Hit it...
It's not over, Brynner.

...-five.
...-son.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.

 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
Forty-seven.
Mason.  Mason!
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...
Got that?
...to talk, son.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...hands!
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...there's a colonel...
Just go check the temperature.

 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
It doesn't hurt.
Do you know him?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
None.
That's too bad.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Oh, my, yes.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Hello.
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
They don't kill a guy for that.
No thanks.
Where's that?
Plus what I owe you?
I said okay, Jake.
Then what'll you do?
The apple core?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Hello, Jake.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
And why's that?
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
You and your husband never discussed her?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
...Just a minute...
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Unless what?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
No, I think I'd remember.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
What's wrong?
Give me an example.
She's too upset.
What about?
Yes.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
I want to see her.
No...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Sophie.
I think I got something.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
You'll find one of those people.
Yeah, Sophie.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Only when I breathe.
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
You're a married man, am I right?
Yes?
Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Then go home and forget about it.
But...
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Gittes.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Course, she settled down nicely.
Then why don't you change jobs? 
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Then where's the money?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
I can't take shorthand.
Three cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Has he said when he'll finish?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I know that, Emily -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
How old did you say you were?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
Susan, it seems to me -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Tired?
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
They do it only because you do!
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
I've got to think of Emily -
I'm drunk.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Yes.
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Yes, sir.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Well, thanks a lot.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Jesus!
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Dick.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Train. It took eight hours.
It's not what you think.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
But you were.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I'm just kidding.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Like you're better!
Pack of cigarettes.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
You don't want to know.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Seven months.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
There's more?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
What kind of show?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
The milkmaids.
Vermont?
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
I know.
You know what pisses me off the most?
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Design major.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
Twenty-two; same as us.
That's embarrassing?
Shut the hell up.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Who found him?
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Living proof.
Because I'm happy.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
What happened to title dictates behavior?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
What time did we go to the funeral?
Thirty-seven.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Why do you say that?
How do you figure?
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Yes.
Excuse me?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
The white kind.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
At least they weren't lit.
How much money did you leave up there?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three including you.
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
He requested this?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
Let it go...
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Thank you for the lasagne.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
You open?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Check this out, he's from Russia.
Did he say "making fuck?"
He really wants to play metal?
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
And... he told you all of this?
I... I don't know what to say.
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!
I copy.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
You know how the airlines are.
Go on, fetch.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
The money!
Glad you could drop in.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Fine, I guess...
Can I count as fast as I like?
Sure you can.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
That's a virtue isn't it?
You can stop right there.
Enough.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Hello, Gabriel.
I don't think you do.
Which could maybe what?
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
You got to go back now!
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
It was great.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Gabe are you alright?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
I won't do it.  No way.
He'll freeze.
Travers, you're not running things.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Oh, my God!
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Where's the third one, Travers?
This way.
Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
So this is the young man?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Fine, sir, fine.
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Good.
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Fine, fine.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What do I want?
Yes sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
C of E, sir.
Blue eyes?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Vitamins will it be then?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Oh.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Indeed.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Pitiful rookerful...
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Bottega.
Most of the time.
But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Just had one.
When was the last time you took one?
Max...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
A deer?
You still carrying passengers?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Remember what you played?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
So?  It was a random thing.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Elvis?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I was with Max when he got the call.
Hi, Ma.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...why is everything always about you...
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Me, specifically?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I don't think I can do this.
Try some deep breathing.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Get rid of 'em.
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
I'm sorry.
Doesn't cover everything.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
How long have you been a hit man?
Good.  Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing.  Or remember we all die anyway...
No, not just that.
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Slow down!
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Not for years.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
He says a dog bit his nose.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Yes.
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Was that who I thought it was?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Right here in Manhattan.
You will?
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Connecticut.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
I'm sorry.
Without a song in my heart.
I love you, too.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Yeah, I do.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Hope there's a cartoon.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
I disagree.
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Meaning...
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
David --
Ellie.
Actually I'm running late --
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you?
J39 Z186...?
Got a bogey, boss?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Can't we get rid of them?
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Is that your official response?
Talk to him.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Many others.
So we passed some kind of test?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
What day?
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I don't follow.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Meaning...
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Git your shovel and git to work.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? It wasn't such a hell of a life.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Lookit her bounce.
We saw the broads.
Git to work!
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Pair'a nines.
A cold drink? Okay?
Well, whatta we got here?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
But, Luke...
Like I always do?
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Fear of what...
When was the last time you washed your hair?
What?  What'd I do?
You bastard!
The first two murders.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Is it an ongoing case?
She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Is there a phone booth there?
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Classy madonna.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Detective Niccoletti?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
There, that's better.
It's about time.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You're not envious?
It does.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
One of your suitors?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
You're kidding.
Hard to say.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What's up with you?
Fuck me.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
Tell us every detail.
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
But you're checking it out.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
So, it's over?
Where to?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Yeah?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
I think I should go home.
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Aunt Lily?
What is it? Are you OK?
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Well then why'd it happen?
I love you so much.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
But what about that math project?
Yeah.
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
What?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Where did they go?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Where's your brother?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Okay.   How much?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And the other half?
Thank you.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
I can't believe you didn't check.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I've got a way with people.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
What room number?
There has to be.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
You guys used to work together?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Yeah.   It's mine.
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
Mr. Zammito?
Uh huh.
No shit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
You like shoes?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What are you doing?
Why?
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
A little?
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
Okay.    Okay.
You're back!
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I didn't have the heart.
And if I use them to kill you?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Do you know her?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
I'll give them to you.
You know about Lo?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Give it back!
You shouldn't have come.
Let's stop a moment.
I will.
Jen...
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Care for a hot dog?
No onions?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
My name.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
It's only a flesh wound.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Who?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
You don't even remember...
T-Bird?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
What the hell are you?
Shelly?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
You'll be alone.
Don't waste my time.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
I don't think so.
Are you okay?
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
You what?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Junior.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
A friend wrote me.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Why are you being so dramatic?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
About what?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need a lift?
And that's a bad thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What are you reading?
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Yes it does.
I can't win with you.
Because I'm in love with you.
How am I a hypocrite?
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
That's great.
What are you saying?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Who is it?
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I did?
I look terrible.
I was just kidding.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
What are you doing?
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
Need any company?
Yummy.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Who is this?
What do you mean?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
I'll think about it...
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
You would not believe what--
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Who are you calling?
Yippy.
Shut up.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Where is she?
You didn't?
Some other time.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Get off me!
I think you have your answer.
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
Let me get that for you.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I did?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
Yes, darling.
But where did you get it, Amy?
Where'd you get this, darling?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
What do you mean?
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Well, it seemed to me --
I thought you were with Amy.
That's the Farren house.
Hello, Amy.
Can't you tell me later?
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
But where do you come from?
But where is that?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Yes, Amy.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
But she's such a nice lady.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
I like stories.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Hurry!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
There was a sale.
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Does she have PMS?
Anything's better than Mark.
Only to see.
Or if there's a full moon.
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Maybe they have to pee.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I've been here. What day is it?
Okay, I gotta go.
DON'T call the police.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
Fall in love.
I'm cleaning my stove.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I think George knows.
Hello?
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Where'd you get the bike?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
What are those?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
They do? Oh no...
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
I'm going to take a shower.
We didn't have sex.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
We can get a warrant if you like.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
We only live a few blocks apart.
You think mafia hit?
What of?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
His wife.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Please, they'll kill me...
What is this place?
Was that for real down there?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Where are we going?
People...  after me.
What?
What?  Who has?
Yes.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
I'm nothing then.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't say a .
What?
Is this dangerous or anything?
For a month.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Up and around?  Soon?
I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
What's with the cameras?
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
And who's gonna find out?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
So what do we do?
That'd be great.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Perceptual?
Oh... Thanks.
Fertility beads.
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Yeah.
What?
Really?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
I can't say.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
I care about the homeless.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
You1re leaving, too?
You find people jobs?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
So this is it?
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
What is it?
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Curse?
That sounds like a curse to me.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
You are dying, too.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
It's because of me.
It's been fired.
Tricks...Jesus...
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
Doing fine, sir.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
Charlie...
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Chris!
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A madman.
A crazy madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
So what do you think of my father?
What?
I've found it.
Found what?
A play, dummy.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
what?
No thanks.
I'll come to the performance.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
And no questions asked.
Now look what you did!
I saved your life is what I did!
I don't know where it is!
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Finnegan...
You want ME to go up there?
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Joey...it's okay...
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
She's gone...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Someone's back there.
What is it man?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
They did not!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
Let's go!!!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
I know! I fuckin' know!
I do!!!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Sure. Why not.
I have to go.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Oh. Fine.
Yeah?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
Not so good.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Here.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
What are you doing?
We... Three bullets.
You should have put that on last night.
I don't think about the shot that much.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
Nick, he just came back.
From Nam?
It's ahead, by the tree.
How many bullets?
No way. No fucking way!
Watch it, shithead!
Then lemme have 'em.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
The fuck I did!!!
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
My man Dubbs.
Fuck you - fuck you.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Need help?
I drive.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
See those guys?
You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
What else did he get?
Rip Van Winkle.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
They always are.
Hi.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
Who are these people?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
Lying to you -- Why should I?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
It hasn't opened yet?
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
But I like the new one better.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Stevens!
Now run along, Daniel.
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
I do -- and I think you should too.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Well, I'll be -- 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
You know darn well it is.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
You want me to go around --
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
We can still use my butter money.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Jabez!
Mary--
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
There is nothing to worry about now.
Mary --
Mary --
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Mary! Come back ...
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Hard luck -- like me.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
My son ... what's the matter?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hullooo!
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
It's okay, it's okay.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
One of yours?
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
Put it down now.
Go on.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
...I've missed you.						*
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
This is --
Gene -- you smilin'?
Yes, I would.
Aw, hey...
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
What about the kids?
Hey, don't take the car!
Well, how'll I get home?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Well...
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Yeah.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
What kind of things, Leon?
I'm afraid.
How many you got in there?
Sonny-boy, one word?
You frisk me.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
He wanted to kill me!
They were ...
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
Howard, give him the keys...
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Now, you -- what's your name?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
What if I take you with me?
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I'll be God damned if you will.
They look like good kids.
Special to me, too.
No you don't.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You shouldn't start now.
Where's the money?
You mean that?
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
We'd kill ourselves.
Wyoming.
What?
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
We can't stay here.
Maybe...
No!
And if you can't deliver them?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Okay.
Yes.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
Cunt.
Hello?
What did he say about the arm?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
We're late.
Fast and or furious.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Jade.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
What responsibilities?
I'm coming.
Nice!
I'm getting paid...
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
What?
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Tina, what do you want me to do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Tina, you're sweating.
It's 'pose to be cold.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
It's e-vit-able.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
I understand.
I love you, my brother.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Sez who?
I know this.
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Take it easy, Pop.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
In the new library there.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Come over around seven.
Would you like something to drink?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
What?
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
A raft.
Who?
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
What?
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, what are you doing here?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
My Lord!
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I can assure you...
So, this is Leto the Just...
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Will we see a worm?
Why do they come?
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
THE PAIN!
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
But you're a big star!
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Bela, what happened?!
I didn't feel well...
Goulash.
I never said I could ad-lib...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Eddie, you screwed up.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
This is kind of a stream--
Isn't he?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
This is my way of telling you --
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
It's a damn good role.
It takes me comfortable.
I'm no good.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Goddamn landlord.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Mr. Reynolds!
Yes?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Is there a script?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
I don't think he's a schmuck.
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
You can't talk that way about my movie.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Did you find it boring?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
The poor girl's out of a job.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Yes!
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
At what point?
Come on...
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
What?!
You're nuts.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Yes?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
What are you talking about?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
Are you asking me?
What does this mean?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
I mean bad.
It's... okay
Well, when you put it that way.
Leave. Go.
Really?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I know, I ...
Everybody hates me!
There's a list.
This is going right up your ass.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
What do we have to do?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
You're in show business?
I'm making a tape.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
What?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
I don't know.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Who is it?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Why me?
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
That girl's an idiot.
Mm.
pierdo.
A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Dick... Dick,..
What d'you got?
Yeah?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I guess you know why you're here
Why are you lecturing me?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Yes?
Uh-huh.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Okay, Jim. I understand.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Which door?
Could you get this? I can't
More this way.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Okay, let's say
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
So?
For what?
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Yeah.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
This business, Captain?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
How's it going to look on your report?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Say what?
They shot him in his library.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
No.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
And now you'll provide them.
John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
That's right.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
You make a mistake?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm curious about you.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Right now, before I back down.
Do you have any proof?
Is she?
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Have we met before?
Really?  How?
Nothing.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
I don't know what that means.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'm doing a transfer now.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Wait. What do I do?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
Did you call anyone?
Them.
That wasn't so hard.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
Feeling lucky?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
I'm married.
I'll say.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<u>What's</u> your point.
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
A police report.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
What?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Sorry.
I know.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
It wasn't me.
Is Eric in school?
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
Just reporters.
Does that hurt?
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
That ain't me.
And then what?
DePinto?
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
You being audited?
We're screwed.
You have to.
I've never met him?
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We'd rather not--
What's his name?
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Why?
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
Table 122?
Rachel's dead?
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
To the cops?
What's your opinion?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
What happened?
What about the tapes?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Sir--
Lyle?!
You're kidding me.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
So they know everything.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
What's your ETA?
Yes?
How'd you get in the building?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Why did you follow me yesterday?
He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Absolutely.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
When were you most happy?
Now.
What?  No!
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
This is - what is this?
Arabic?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
Why did you hold his collar?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Yes.  Absolutely.
You too.  Good luck!
How are you?
Is this you?
Don't cut me.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
I see.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
To arm-twisting.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
How?  How can you see anything?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
You'd better be.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
We've got to catch him in the act.
I'm in the middle.
He's on to something bigger.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I'll call an ambulance.
For God's sake.
The Empress Death Mask.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Oh?
What's my problem? You want a list?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Nice spot.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
That's because I wanted them to!
Someone was expecting that.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Our equipment has arrived.
He wasn't.
And--
Yes. Yes.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
A parting gift from the Empire.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Four billion dollars.
Jesus.
Put this on!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
You two make quite a couple.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
I figured that out.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
See you.
Probably not.
250,000?
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What the hell is this doing here?
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
They did?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah?
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Course I did.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I like this case.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
And, what, I'm not serious?
How dare you take that away from me.
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
You're not gonna be there.
Why not?
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Great.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
That is not what I'm --
I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
No, I need my car --
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Next week.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Will he finish what he begins?
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks at Han.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
That's right.
He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Sir, I was wondering ...
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
We've got to get out of this shower.
How do I look?
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Where?
That depends.  Where are we?
You keep logs?  My, how organized.
Can you trust him?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Probe?  What probe?
How's your mining operation going?
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Not really.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What'd you say?
What?
You rest now.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
That they are.
I feel cold.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
No!
It won't get through the blockade.
Did you call the Zoo?
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
And we can watch ...
They look pretty docile.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
Who's that?
Ooww!
You told me he was dead.
Oh Cuervo...
What?
All right, so I made another deal.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
Where do I put ashore?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where are they going?
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Yeah, kinda.
Looking to get out.
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Are you crazy?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
Arthur.
How? Where?
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
What is this place, Merlin?
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Who is, then?
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
You, my lord.
To me? But why?
The law forbids it.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What didn't he tell you?
What did the doctor say?
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
What!
A stimulant.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
We still think the temporal lobe...
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
He didn't mention her.
Oh yeah, since when?
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
No, is Regan aware of it?
What kind of stuff?
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
I found it.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
People get tired.
What's playing.
You'd like that?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
Uoy era ohw.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
And let my cry come unto thee.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...look down in pity...
Are you a relative?
Give me the keys.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
How's the birthday girl?
When they coming in?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
It was an accident.
What d'ya got?,
Why the interest?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
Your older brother.
So what'd we get her?
Frank?
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Your doorbell doesn't work.
It wasn't like that.
A gust of wind killed him.
What's that?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
First night?
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
What's the matter with you?
Two hours ago!
She's a big girl.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
A useless talent.
They were simple songs.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
What's it for?
Seventy-one
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
You weren't there.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Jack!
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
I'll take the Mallory.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
The audience was a little off tonight.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
How should I take it?
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Where's my name?
What's he talking about?
Nine?
They're nines.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Jack, you with us?
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Virgins?
Great?
Peggy Lee?
What'd she sing?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Huh?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Is that important?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Gotta go.
Funny hours.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
No.
The name's Baker --
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Where's egghead?
His kid's sick.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Forget it.
Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
You were good.
Nina?
Friend.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
So ... ?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Losing his teeth.
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Older than me.
Huh? Oh, no.
He's lying.
Jesus Christ, Castor.
Perfect fit.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Is that what you think?
... I was dreaming ...
No.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
When did you start smoking?
You've got someone in your office.
Castor's escaped!
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
... That's great.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Big Ed’s.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
I've got everything I need.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Where were you?
Because that’s where I live.
No, she’s not.
How can you do that?
Do what?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
C’mon.
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
I need to tell you something.
And now...?
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I’m out of the doghouse?
I could stay here forever...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
This place is a perk, Kate.
Annie goes to a great school.
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Are you okay, Jack?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Not with what they pay me...
Jesus, Jack...
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Last night was great...
I want to see you again.
That’s totally see through...
I mean...
I can't take this.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
He's made a few changes.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Ben.  Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
About me?  How sweet.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
He's not responsive --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
You're hot!
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
You're really cramping my style here.
I'm driving.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
For science.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Are you kidding?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
-- and why we need you.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
We must!
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
What about Dr. Michaels?
We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
I'm married.
Uh -- what?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
She started shrieking, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Well, okay, it's -
Yeah, you already said that.
Okay.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Oh, don't be silly.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Where you girls from?
In what way?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Yah, that can happen.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Yah.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
Huh? Yah?
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah!
...Dad?
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
...Dad?
What's goin' on there?
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Carl somethin'?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, pretty good.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
No, I didn't...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Better times.
Yah?
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Gustafson's accountant.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
He's at Norstar.
He was killed in action.
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
No.  I found something new.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
You are?!
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
I'd like to thank the academy...
Why are you doing this?
You're kidding.
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
So you're staying in tonight?
It's time for you to leave.
Where?  Here?
I think everything's okay here.
What?
Yeah?
Is that what you're calling it?
Answer the question!
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
What?
I'm sorry, but I...
Who's this?
How have you been?
Who do you think I am?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
...no ...no ...
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't... think so.
Do what you like.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
What's that?
The fight.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
What?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
I said I promise!
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Fucking sweet.
What are we doing?
You know what I mean.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
I want to know --
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
I'm not asking you to.
This conversation...
Answer me, Tyler.
What... ?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Fuck you.
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
What?
Paraffin.
What?
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
What?
Maintenance.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
Should we knock?
Carter.
Tell me again how it started.
You mean Alex Browning.
Shouldn't we pull over?
Want me to drive?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Stop the car!
Carter, get out!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
Show me how it operates.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How do we get upriver?
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Why'd they want us?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Yes you can.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
About 22 hours on site.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
My parents were divorced.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
No really..I can't.
Most men are.
<u>What</u>!
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
He's not a moron.
What do you think?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
I'm not married.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
But I gave it to you!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Will you shut-up!!!
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
What?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Holdin' my penis...
No just Parry.
What a gyp.
What are we about to do?
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Divorced.
A wig?
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
You're depressed that I come along.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Okay, Ray...
No.
Where are you going?
Who?
Can I get you anything else?
Tea.
Robert Eroica...
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Uhm hmm.
With applesauce?
It's none of your business!
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
You don't call that music, though.
Why?
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
No, it isn't what I think.
No, don't do that...
That's right.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I have to talk to you.
No, I can't...
What?
Oh, for chrissakes...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
And what about love?
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Why you have an attitude for?
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Victor.
You got a boyfriend?
So what you think of me?
Fa what?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
What are you going that way for?
You gonna talk to him?
Like this?
Wha'?
Who?
What she look like?
What?
Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
They didn't do anything.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
I don't know. I don't have any.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Just relax.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
So what do you figure?
Like tonight.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Gum thought Brazil.
Oh my God!
You may be right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I know.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
We can't talk about it here.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Do you have a passport?
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Yeah.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
John Ultrarelamensky.
Alan's in Utah.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
Lunch...
Can I ask you a question?
He never sees them and I never met them.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
They just left, sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
One.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
Your call is come through.
Where is she?
Two...
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Get out of here.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
You were going to can me, right?
No, I ain't got you...
Excuse me?
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Did she tell you anything?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Hello, Ford...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Ford, you were right!
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
I'm sorry...
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Well try, okay?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Comment va-t-elle?
Le sommes nous?
Sale boulot.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
We must follow it.
There's nobody like that on six.
Where the hell is it?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
You got the warrant?
Timezit?
What I know is what I told you.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Damn.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Okay, start pedaling.
Uh, hello?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Queens, New York.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What?
That's impossible.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What's that?
On the job?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
What are you talking about?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Whatta we do now?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, you still there?
Yeah, I think so...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
What's wrong?
How you feeling?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Nah, just working the job.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Cool it, Andy.
Breakfast?
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Think you can figure it out?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What's the matter?!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Which one is it?
It's deceiving.
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What happened that night?
Are they following us?
Bullseye!
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
...And I said, shut up!
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
No.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Are they grown-ups?
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
No, I --
Legs giving you trouble?
Hello...
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me.
She's beautiful.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
About what?
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
I'm literally going to kill you!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
But she might be in trouble...
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Yeah.
What murders?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
What a beautiful day.
You're telling a lie.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Yes...
Hi, Sean.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Press a button and they give us money.
Don't talk like that.
Very dangerous.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Is it safe?
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
That's completely crazy.
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
She is kicking you out.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
What will we talk about?
Yes.
What do we want?
Your father said you might be here.
Who the hell cares?
Joanne Bourne.
Washed away.
This could be it!
Who is it?
What do you want?
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I lost it. I lose everything.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
How come you got the kid with you?
Now that's a complicated subject.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Yes.
This could be it.
I think I remember.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
He's a very sweet man.
Where are you going now?
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were a man of God.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
Hm.  Is it?
A great deal.
Do you find me stubborn?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
You mean a general strike?
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Assuming we are in agreement?
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
How much extra?
Something's not right.
Where do we start?
Suit yourself.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.
You had to be a right-hander.
You wish.
Call German.
They'll recognize me.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
If you say so.  The stripe.
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
You may as well invite her here.
In case you get back before I do.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What do you think?
Vincent...Vincent...
I hope he's not just a body.
How do I square the accident?
No bother.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
You didn't know?
What exactly is wrong?
What about the car?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
The name?  For the certificate.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Just like old times?
Where did you get them developed?
How does it taste?
$250,000 right off the top.
Why are you laughing?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
Bullshit.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
A man helped me open it...
And switched keys.
Fifteen minutes.
There better be a guy with the
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got it all figured.
That would be the first time.
We better stick here till tonight.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
You okay?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Two.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
Can he trust you?
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
When did you find out?
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Why?
That's not good enough.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Yes.
Once a week?
You know Sid Fletcher?
What kind of entertaining?
You've been watching the film.
What girl?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Thanks for coming.
How's school?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I mean, what for?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Nowt.
Are you a traveller?
What is it?
Is he staying the night?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
Are you awake?
No. Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
Three hundred altogether?
That's right.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
They came in and they, you know...
...that's right...
Who?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
I heard that they were running cold.
What?
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
That's the truth...
You...
That's what I...
What do you mean?
How do you know he'd buy them?
No.
You didn't?
Did you?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Did I say that?
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Oh, yes, George.
In the abstract...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Fine.
I can't close 'em.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
No.
You think so?
Will you excuse...
Will you excuse us please?
Did the leads come in yet?
Oh, God, I hate this job.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
What two?
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
Why?
Alright.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Why?
Because I say so.
Is that what you're saying?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
What does that fucking mean?
It's not impossible.
Mmm.
Excuse me...
How do you know I made it up?
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
What?
No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
They took the phones...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Home...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Yeah.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
Tuesday.
I don't know.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
I...
The deal.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Guess what the Machine did?
I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm going home.
You did?
Yes.
...you want to go out today...?
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
John...
Are you alright?
I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
I can't.
To do business.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
What if we don't pay?
I got surprises for everybody!
I want to talk to you, Michael.
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
We're making an investment in Havana.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
...Who?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
We have time.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Am I a prisoner?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Hello?
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Wait... there's something else.
The room has a bug in it.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Yes.
Whose orders are these?
Sleeping inside me.
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
On a plane back to Sicily.
Kay, I told you...
Are you Klingman?
Who's asking?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
However I can help you...
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I want you to settle on their terms.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
On the phone?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yes.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
It's not what you think.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What was wrong?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
But why?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Very well put.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
How long were you...?
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
I didn't --
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
A very lucky thing indeed.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
I'm very sorry.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
I'm up.  Thanks.
Where's Betty?
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
That's funny, Mr. Whale.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Yeah -- ?
Get out of here, Ray --
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
No...
Kip.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Keys were in it ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
You mean the poor --
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
Forget that ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
There's no one left ...
He's in some trouble ...
What time of year?
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
What era was that -- ?
What are you doing here?
Where you off to -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
"Mitch?"
What's wrong with her -- ?
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
What the hell's that -- ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
Is he still working here ?
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
What happened to Sway?
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
So what's in there -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Not really -
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
What do you do?
The bag with the envelopes.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Watch this.
You want the melon?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
I gotta go home.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Why not?
Thanks, Chuck.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
How you doin'?
Is that true?
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
I'm not sure--
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
Somethin's in my room.
Where is it touching you?
What're you doing?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
What are you smiling at?
Hey, how you doin'?
Thank you.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Just meet with the boy once a week.
Who?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
He won't be a failure!
So I hear you're taking some time.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
That's very presumptuous.
I did.
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Why thank you.
No.
Fine.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
Yeah.
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't want the job.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
The wrench, why?
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
What?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Yeah.
I have twelve big brothers.
Bullshit.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
I guess so.
Like me?
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Is that what you think--
What about your twelve brothers?
Yes, I do, Will.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
But ain't no reason--
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
And you ain't ashamed?
What you figger to do?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Lookin' for a job?
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
You people got a lotta nerve.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Mad, Ma?
Yes'm, that was it.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I could hide you, Tommy.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
You can have this for ten cents.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
What's this?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
--No.
Really...? So what?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Are you going to the reunion?
Bad people.
Seven it is.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Yes.
Is it something you've done?
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
We're both professionals, Oatman.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
You understand the psychology of the job.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
I don't think so.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
He didn't.
There's nothing to be done about it.
What's it look like?
That's wonderful, Mom.
Jim?
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
No. You drove us here.
He gave me a great deal.
That's too bad.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
You lived in Chicago?
A jogger, huh?
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Why didn't it work out?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Everything under control?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Would you like to see that?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
You buckled up?  You cold?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
When? Tonight?
What?
Who is it?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
I'm sorry.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
Aw... that's so sweet.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Huh-huh. You?
You're allergic to hay.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
How are you feeling about work?
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
They fired you?
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
Don't you go to school?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
She gonna be long?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Sure?
No, not yet.
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
You think it's cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Oh wow, we are fried.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
What are you doing?
Up all night again, huh?
Revenge.
I found it! I found it!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
What the hell are you doing?
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Are you challenging me?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
Thank you.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
How?
Dade.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Uhhhmm...
There's a new virus in the database.
My name is the Plague.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Hello, operator services.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Are you two okay?
We've been better.
What's going on?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Brady!
Get back!
Shit!
An accident?
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
I can't.
Rachel!
You remember Lindsay don't you?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
He's here, Sheriff.
Its true, Sheriff.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It isn't a man.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
How's it powered?
It's over.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
You blame everything on kids.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Probably Mister Riddle.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Will you call me tomorrow?
They could be.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
There's nothing else I can do.
PROBABLY going.
What did you use before?
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Wow, it's the red one?
Yeah.
Oh, geez, yeah.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
No, he called late last night.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Is this your first job?
You're Holly.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Like what?
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, God.
Yeah, you would.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, sure.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I didn't sleep all night.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Are you in a bad mood?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
You've been with someone!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Yes!
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Why?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Huh?
I think he'll find that satisfying.
That's a beauty!
Oh!
This is the second opinion.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Okay.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Singing?
Awwww...
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Good.
Can we, can we go?
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I was so bored!
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
...in a really horrible way.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, you can tell me.
Really?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Yeah.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I am.  You-you made my day.
Thanks.
Mickey?
Oh...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Uh-huh.
Aren't you glad to see me?
A reward for what?
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...<u>please</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Or, perhaps...
...why?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You want me to be?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
I'm not.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
How was America?
What's up...?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Why did he come back?
No.  And...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Starling...?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Waal...
I said how's your baby...?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...how so?
...yes.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
How could you know?
...Franklin.
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
...I'm sorry....?
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
You should get Married.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Ask me when we get home.
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...no...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
Yes.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
Freeze!  You're busted!
What are you gonna do about it?
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
No, they're not from Wendy.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Fuck off.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Because you're an idiot.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
What are you doing here?!
King David.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Is she dead?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
I don't really like your friends either.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
We killed them, didn't we?
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
This knife is filthy.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
We on tonight man?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
Hello!
Come on, sit up.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Just a couple more . . .
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Isn't it beautiful!
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
I understand, I think. Other women?
Well?
Sorry.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
I have my connections
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You win! Okay pull over.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
Where's my wife?
A little? Try unbelievably.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
-Tawny.
Hey. Can I borrow something?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
Often, uh.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Turn that thing off.
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
That's not what I mean...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
It's not right, Gale...
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
You didn't... get it on with him?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Hey, c'mon.
Give it here, Bernard.
Are you being helped, sir?
-- institution.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
No, no, no, no.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Do you have a family?
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Baby, what is it?
Mommy!
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Where'd he go?
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
But it's what we want.
What?
Did you hear what he said?
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
I thought we'd be happy here.
Where should I hide the car keys?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
I think it's time I came home now.
What?
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
And I can't help having a cold.
No.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
What is it?
This ties in with Nash.
We don't have any proof of that.
Anything from the bank?
I think it was England.
When did you get back?
Central Park.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Good evening, Lieutenant.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Must you do that?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Yes.
You can go first.
Why?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
New York is dangerous place.
Yes.
Why?
Good evening.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
We found him this morning.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
No.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I guess so.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jen?  Are you all right?
I'm going to my desk.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
You have his address?
What if it goes south?
What do you mean?
I need to work out some stuff.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
Thanks for the shirt.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
What's going on?
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
She didn't answer.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
The kids are in here!
How about you and your sister?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Okay.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Who is it?
Where are my children?
Yes.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Excuse me?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Their people?
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Satellites?
Get in.
Your police are at the gate?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
It was substantial.
What does it matter.
Please do not talk like this.
Out? Where are you going?
The staff, the guests.
Paul, are you there?
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
And how the hell are we going to do that?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
There must be some other way out.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
What's down there?
Pritchett, is that you?
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
Oh, Jesus....
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --
I think we should have taken a right back there.
Good point.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
-- the sadistic prick --
What are you talking about?
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
Steven --
No...
What?
And then what happens?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
What?
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
What's the matter?
Did you find her?!
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
What about all my other stuff?
Where is she?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Are you playing tricks on me?
...set up some more things.
But do you agree with me?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
How are we doing?
I think everything's ready.
What?
We're not going.
You're bleeding.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Oh, that's nice...
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
What's going to happen?
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
There's something through that wall!
Well what is it!
What do you mean?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
How have you ... ?
But I don't know what's going on.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
What am I looking for?
Joey ... ?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
You gonna buy?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
But how in God's name ...
Really?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
Alex!
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Don't you just hate kids...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
I was the Warden?
What have you been doing?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Oh Hudson...
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
We're here to say, your government was right.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Bunny, not you too?
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Why does this have to be so hard...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
The Dancing Dingus!
Sharp.
The Hudswinger!
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
What a horrible little person.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
You don't say.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
What a beautiful thought.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
For Pete's sake, Norville!
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
I can't print this!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Muncie.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...Geez.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...Yeah, go ahead.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
...education, were you?
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
I'm afraid so.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Does she suffer?
But it's so far away...
I like her already.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
I'm sorry...
Wesley can be very entertaining.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I often do.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
Help me? How?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Wesley!
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
So maybe you'll come too?
You all right there?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
What's for dessert?
In the car.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Hi dad.
Classes?
Grades?
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What do you think we're doing, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
I saw you on your bike today.
With Mikey?
Nobody.
Mom. Are you ok?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Um, Libbets Casey.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Geometry?
Want some gum?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
Yeah. Yours?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Can I come?
Charles, what time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
He's dead.
It feels warm.
Nice kid.
I had him!
I have to get back.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
What I saw?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
What happened at that signing?
You know my plan of action.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Looks like the natives are restless.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
Will...I...
I told you I don't remember.
I don't know.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
What about him?
Told you I could write an ending.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Yes, and very beautiful.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
Come, you're going to feed now.
What have I done?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
I can't.
Paris? You came from Paris?
I didn't want to kill her.
No... You come back to me Louis...
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
You can't look at them...
Shall we go on?
And the child who did die?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
I thought you were out of town!
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
Don't even think about it.
Nice move.
Cancer in a box.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Julie...
There's no way to lock it.
No, you're not.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
Must have missed the sign.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Your daughter is ill.
What is her illness?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
There is something evil about her.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
You what? To save me?
By letting me help you.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
No, of course not.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Hey, who's that?
You sent for me, sir?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Hiya, George!
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
When'd you see him last?
Daddy!
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Oh, it's wonderful.
You want a martini?
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
What gives?
Nothing.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Pop!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Would you rather leave?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
Where's your coat and hat?
Sure, sure I am.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
How fast is enough?
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Is she responsible for the punch?
Your dad must be really pissed.
That's awful.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
Coming up!
I thought you said she was going with us?
No!  It's still there!
Aren't you off-duty?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
What camera?
Where to?
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Oh, c'mon.
I kind of had plans....
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
Wait a minute....
Too late, it's written.
You don't make enough.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Do you?
What makes you think there might be?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Sound?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
It's good with coffee.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What's wrong?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What're you doing?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
What for?
Can I go swimming?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Get a dance yet?
That's a crock of shit.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
What's that mean?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Nope.
What is it?
It'll be fun, come on!
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Heading back?
You're going out.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
How many sharks have you killed?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Pre-opening jitters.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Where are you going?
Michael...
How the hell did it get in here?
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Kathryn...
Finally.
Yes.  It's faster.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
It's a shark's tooth!
So?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
Come on!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Michael, you're not going down there.
I am.  You're not.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Nobody told me.
I'm sorry.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Still sleeping.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Philip.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Give me a ride?
Sure.
Massachussettans aren't.
Are you really?
Take it up.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Look great, don't I?
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Sure.
Daddy, why can't I...?
Can I make sandwiches...?
Where are you going?
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
No fair, I'm not armed.
Close the door.
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
Sit down, Ma....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Why'd you come out here?
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I can't....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
Why?
They had them on the big one....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Come on, Hoagie....
Feathers all over the place....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
Hey!
Put me down....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
Money is money....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
When I invited you...
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
What's so funny about that?
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
What about Carla's gig?
Who grows more beautiful....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
Only me and Mom ..
What does that mean?
Because, don't get into it ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Did he shut you down?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
And did they?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
<u>You</u> put it in there.
You must have some idea about him.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Me?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
No.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Do you pray?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
No I'm not.
Why?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Interview over, Blattis ...
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
You think John would like it?
Is that Margie?
So tonight she confesses?
You want something, darling?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
This can't be happening to me.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Oh come on --
Oh no.
Thanks.
Well, good evening.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Oh God.
What --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
I don't need you to "stick."
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
He's coming over.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Not right now, Jerry.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
I got it.
No, I don't know.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm sorry I asked.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
I'm fine.  What's up?
... dick?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
Hi.
Shut up!!!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Do you think it goes all the way across?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
What did you say?
It's not safe.
Well what?
That one time was just the bumper.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I thought you were an expert.
That does sound lucky.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I'd better get going.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
How much of this island have you explored?
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Resentful.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
I don't even know this woman.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Okay.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
We took to the rock.
It's... behind... us.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
We can't stay in here!
Because it exists.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Funded by whom?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Ian.  It's guano.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Oh my God.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Why would they care what we think?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Oh, shit.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - a gizzard - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
It's all right.
I get ah - -
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Why not?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Yeah.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
I threw up.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
You're married?
Kids get scared.
For today, I guarantee it.
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
He left us!  He left us!
What's that?
Let's go!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
What?
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
Are you going to plead insanity?
Well?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
How do we prove it?
Me too. I'm drunk.
How's that possible?
Have you worked here long?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
You work in the cemetery.
-- You appreciate my writing.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
What an extraordinary request!
A true friend would do it.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I usually take lunch by the River.
In a small way.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Why would you suppose so?
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
Tonight?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
They're not obliged to tell.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
No -- not this time.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
... A piece of paper ...
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
Ludwig.
Women are all you have on your mind!
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I photographed it extensively, father.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Ann ... Ann!
They' re dead.
Native costume?
Did you see her?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
That's your monkey, Denham.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
She was with you after she left Frank.
Yes indeed.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
What was better? I made better bait?
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Like for you to look for the man.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
-- We can talk --
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Could I ask some questions?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
I don't get you.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
What am I supposed to say?
Where'd you spend last night?
How is it back there?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Someone's been doing all these things.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
I've just got a few --
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Then how are you involved?
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Does that distress you?
On earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
All it is is onions and gravy.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
No.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Sleep tight.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
I don't understand, daddy.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
A heavy drinker?
How long was that?
I was not a failure.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Joanna, I don't give a--
Ted, do you love him?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
I don't know, Jim...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Oh, Christ!
It's going to cost.
Yeah.
Any prospects?
How the hell are you going to do that?
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No, but--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
What are you going to do?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Thelma, if I die--
Ted.
Hey, that's terrific.
Ted, I just heard...
I am sorry, Lhamo.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Do I have money?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
It is an island. American territory.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Britain?
What is the size of our army, now?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
I have more men.
No, Holiness.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
Tell me.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
I haven't broken any laws.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
I'll sue you.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
Go!!!
I do <u>not</u> like you.
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Where is he?!
No way.
I got something on the screen.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
I'm okay.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
No thanks.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
We might as well pack.
Well...
Well...
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
I'll take it!
I'm fine, thank you.
This is a little different.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
You talk to the married couple?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
What?
The somebody else part?
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Are you on drugs?
<u>Kelly</u>--
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Well, except for the one girl.
What girl?
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
What would it take?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
Why? Do you know something about him?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
They all were.
No. Tell me why.
A cattle ranch?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
All right, then tell me how -
But you could. You did.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
What...?
Why didn't you bury those people?
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
He did?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
My letter...
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
You do not know what you are saying!
My God, Alice.
We were headed...
We don't.
And if we're unlucky?
Got a reason to stay.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Yes, sir.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Can you fix it?
Go on!
I need more light on that, Four.
How's astronaut training?
We made it!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
What about our quota?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Okay.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
What the?...
Still bothering you?
Listen to it for Christsake.
How'd you do that?
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
The shack...
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
There are no others.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Nope.
Have you counted the money?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
You all right back there, mate?
So do you know these geezers well?
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
Right, his leg's going now.
There is only three of us here.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
What do you mean?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Tom?
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
And that does include the amp?
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Six.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
I don't know what the big deal is.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
I'm sorry, sir.
Yes, sir--
The--the officers.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
You're testing me?
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Colt Peacemaker.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Best part of the job.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
The Trail of Tears.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
That guy who got shot--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Made some money, came back here--
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
You going to get married?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Pleased to meet you.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
That's where he fell.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
That's right.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Senora Cruz?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Bledso
Charley Wade.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I never said that.
That's me.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Okay? He's not here?
What about it?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
What?
Mom?
What's she singing about?
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
They've got my Amado.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Yeah.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Yeah?
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
Uh-huh.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Gotta be in person.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Yeah.
You think we need a new jail?
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
Yeah. It's quiet--
I know you?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
How much?
Who?
Nix.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Who is he?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You heard right.
I could have lost my fucking hands.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
Right.
I'll tell you.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Are they treating you okay?
How did it go today?
They were jealous of him.
So why did you marry him?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
Oh God!
Harry?
Harry-?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
Somebody killed him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Mr. D'Amour?
Are you a gambling man?
Any movie stars buried here?
I'm afraid she's not in.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
She has no real grip on reality.
Yes...
Harry D'Amour.
You know Vinovich?
Look, Ma, no wires.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And you believed him?
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
One question.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
You could still help me do that.
No!
Bob, it's me.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You'll do it?
What are you doing here?
How long have you been married?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
It's Charlotte.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
That's ok.
That's too scary.
Where'd you grow up?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Yeah.
Do you know where we are?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
What do you want to drink?
Hi, Bob.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Yes.
Oh?
My stockings.
Ok, well... I love you.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
It's Lydia, your wife.
Yeah.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Hospital?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I miss you.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
What time did you make it for?
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You'll do it?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Two negatives always make a positive.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I do.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
What do you mean?
So what'd I miss?
You should think about getting professional help.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
Are you alright?
Maybe that's my problem.
We need all the help we can get.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
There weren't any voices.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
He could see me.
How're you doin' today?
What happened?
Yeah, you met her?
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
What?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Careful.
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Why not?
To do what you love.
Yeah, right.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Hey, munchkin.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
What's up?
I know.
Just not my type, I guess.
I just can.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I know this.  What do you want?
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
God, here we go.
You having fun?
Four.
You do see me standing here, right?
Forget Tonya Randall.
What are we playing for?
Yo, where's the "D"?
What's up?
Sorry about your game.
Hey, what's up.
The "man" again.
What?
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
From basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
At one in the morning?
We still have to go?
Where's your dad?
You work too hard, Pop.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Your door was unlocked.
What do you want?
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Look, I'm busy.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You smell like trouble --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
What's wrong?
Hello?
Oh, she's fine.
It was scary though.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
What?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You just move in here?
Yeah.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
It's not -- what's a 422?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Just Jim.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Let's make a deal.
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
That was so great what you just said.
It's ok.
Yes.
-- can I get you?
It's upstairs.
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
-- no.
It's ok --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Doc it's Janet.
Is it real love?
I have love.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Stay that way.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces.
And how much is braces?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
How's today then?
No.
I'm trying.
I've seen it before.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
Who?
No.
...Lily...?
Hello?
Alright.  Thank you.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
Yes.
In aid of what?
She lived in Tarzana.
Does you mother still work?
Do you have your masters?
...this close...
It's not your given name, right?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
They wouldn't?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
What? What? What now?
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I went out last night.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
--- What was that?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
All your other fluzzies?
Yeah. Yes.
Are you alright?
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
I'll answer anything.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I think that you know.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Pink Dot.
Water.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
We need more dog food --
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Be ready at two --
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Stand up.
Hi.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
This happens....this is something that happens.
God smiled upon us.
What -- ?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
He who is not with us is against us.
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
But --
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
Everyone back.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Who does?
What do we do now?
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Who came?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Where are you?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
I'll take the south end -
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Seattle.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Did you have sex with her?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
Not the Bible?
Read it.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Somebody hurt him?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
As long as they're dead...
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
For Christ's sake, why?
The mark? Yes.
Who is it?
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
That's why the boltcutter.
Have him peel the top label back.
What?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
You worked out well.
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
Do you see?
Yes.
Oh, God.
Do you see?
Not me.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Absolutely,
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
At the store. You doin' some good?
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Will? Are you okay?
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
That's right.
Lt. Fisk said...
What do you want?
She got all right?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
What disadvantage?
Do you have the file with you
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Tank you veddy much.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
I refuse.
Andy?
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
I'm sorry, George...
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Really?
B-but... we saw... your neck...
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Hey Andy, good show.
So?  What do they know?
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Excuse me, Andy...
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Positive.
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Bob.
Bob Gorsky.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
And you are?
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant?
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
They'll be able to track it.
The agents --
No.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
What are you doing?
Do you understand, Neo?
She helped you?
Yes.
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, I don't know --
We need an exit.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
Yeah.
That vase.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
Gee-zus.
They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
What is the Matrix?
Neo, please, you have to trust me.
Are you worried?
I'm going in after him.
Neo, how did you do that?
Do what?
They're hacking his mind.
I'll be all right.
Look fella...this is private...
Why?
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
'Thou art then a king?'
Where to?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
It's the truth, I swear.
Nah.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Shut up!
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Hey, shut up.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
What was it?
Wha?
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Anything specific?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
A paper on that one too?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Sal!... fourteen street.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Well...no.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Look who's talking.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Oh, the goddam party --
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
What are you eating.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Drew, you're out of line.
Well... goodnight.
We have an arrangement now.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Hot or cold.
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
What'd it say?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
'Joe...'
Have we met?
Sit down, Drew.
Why?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
Are you?
But I didn't mean to do it!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Yes.
You loved back?
Rass!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Oh yes, I do.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What do you mean 'free'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
No, I'm not.
No.
Gay?
To bed.
I love your smell.
I don't know who you are.
You're here?
He's taking a nap.
I loved it.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
I'm still here.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
I won't.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Good morning, Bill.
A 'deal'?
What do you mean?
Of course.
Can you keep a secret?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
And more.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I don't know.
What way would you put it?
That's okay.
Yes, I saw you see me.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
This universe?
And I don't give a shit.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
An offense --
I am not a dream.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I don't!
I'm sorry, I --
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Get what?
Good morning, Quince.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Eddie?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
You're not listening --
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Bravo.
You're terrible.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Are you relieved?
Daddy --
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
30.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Where'd you get it?
Yeah, I remember you.
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
You don't remember me.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You know him?
I wasn't helping you for money.
It's not easy to be calm when -
And what did he say?
Where is he?
What are you gonna do?
What does he want?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
What happened?
Neither do I.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Beer, please.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
You don't know him?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Why are you following me?
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Yeah.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
It's a rip and a hit.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Tell them what you want.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
When?
No part of it wasn't real.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
What's our deal?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Alonzo...
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Where the hell are you, man?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Go ahead.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
Where are you?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Oh, good...
C'mon, man!
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
What's it say?
Not French registry?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Why?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
You ain't coming to work?
What you gonna do back there, East?
I ain't sleepy.
For what?
How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Yeah, well, so?
I'm scared.
These guys're good drivers.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
What you got me up here for?
No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
I'm going to Florida.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for anything.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Get down -- where?
Sold. Let's go.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Where?
Want me to take over?
Anybody bitten?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Where'd you get that limp?
Where you staying, Dad?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
Yes...?
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
How much did you have?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Just got some news on Bell.
Know what?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
My God, what the hell are you...?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Honey, just leave it.
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Oh, come on, come on!
Your arm, you can't...
You sure you didn't see one of these?
What?
Oh, my!
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Here.
You're very kind...
What's your new book called?
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I'm getting to believe you.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Yes.
See, isn't this nice?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
--cliff-hangers--
I said that?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
You don't know?
Yes, Paul.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
If I can.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
No, the typing kind.
Marcia, please.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
From her point of view or mine?
I thought you were going to dinner.
What was the top bid?
Not exactly.  Wallis?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
What if I pay the rent?
Where's the bloody -
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
They've got a book for everything.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
Before you are.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Just like old times.
How do you suggest I go about it?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
No.
Why did you phrase it like that?
Twice.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
But why tell us?
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
All ten million.
Always.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
What happened to Jim?
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
What happened?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
I donít think so.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
What about Job?
That's not it.  That's not the list.
Claire.
Higher.  Higher.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay.
Yeah.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
And what did they say?
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Where'd Johnny find you?
How'd he die?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
You think so?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
I've never seen a moon like that.
Kinda gaudy.
Thank you!
It's really cold.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I know what I know.
Yeah.
Why?
Why not?
No.
He's coming.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
No?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I can't. I need my family around me now.
And we'll sell the house.
How's the mother?
No.
We just come from the bank.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
That's incredible.
No idea.
Loretta...
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Can I get another one of these?
What happened?
Thanks, comrade.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
I think it's because they fear death.
I guess you can't invite me in?
I'm freezing
That's my house.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
She's got it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Am I right?
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
Who are the Britons?
You don't vote for kings.
NI!   NI!
None shall pass.
'Tis but a scratch.
You're a liar.
Look!
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
Who are they?
Greetings King Arthur.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Too late.
What?
Yes, I see.
Bloody peasant! 
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Yes, Lord.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Good idea, O Lord!
... Well, we did do the nose.
I'm getting better!
I think I'll go for a walk.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To seek the Grail!
Don't be such a baby.
I dunno, Must be a king.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Gosh - Is he all right?
Father, lad.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
But, Father.
Who are you?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
If we ... er ... 
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Why?
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Sir Gawain.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ...
Oh!
Stop saying the word!
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I've got my duties to attend to.
It's a diary.
I hope to go up next year.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
No doubt you've heard the rumors.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Checked and locked, sir.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Mr Brown.
I am.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
We're going to lose.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
Erysipelas.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
What do they want?
Dead?
Now what seems to be the problem?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
Yeah...
We are talking...
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
No way.
What?
You mean we learn the rules...
And beat it at it's own game.
You got the schematics?
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
What?
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So how did you do it, Alex?
What did he do to you?
I'm thinking!
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
Cool.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I'm going home.
Cynthia...what's going on?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I'll speak to someone.
I agree with what you said...truly.
It will work out.
... What??
Wow!
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Was anyone hurt?
Yes?
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No...I need to sleep.
What's wrong?
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Good luck!
Those men in front, in the car.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Betty Elms.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
Yeah, what for?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
This Denny's.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Why did you build this whole place ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
That's not to tough.
You okay ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What do you mean sir ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
What was that ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
<<belch>>
What happened ?
The power went out in half the park.
Are you okay ?
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Are you okay ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
Don't mention it.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Visualize a spare?
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
What boy likes you?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Was it a nice funeral?
I already bought a ticket.
Hi honey.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
We have a baby?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
But I wanna write about her.
Then I have come to the right place.
Vada?
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
Getting off please.
Boy, you're really into this.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Just come and get it...right here!
DON'T!!!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
But we wouldn't really be related right?
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
No problem.
Committed?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
I should do this myself.
Then you'll be all set.
I think this place is just fine.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
What do you mean?
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
I'm impressed.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Deceased.
Excuse me, what about the job?
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Oh, how do you mean?
Dad??
Yes..
What are you doing.
He was allergic to bees.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Will you tell her I came by?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
For this class?
Please.
No....
We'd love to hear it.
Do you like her?
She's shy.
Shut your big fat mouth!
Hi.
What are they about?
No.
I won, I won!!!
Goodnight.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Oh no!  UUH.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
THIS!! 
I am running faster!!
Come on, let's go.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Then go home, baby.
I should look different.
I honestly wish I could...
Blood oath.
No, he's ruining yours.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
You've been working on this, huh?
And you believe that.
Two words.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I did what I came to do.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Uh, Kimmy...?
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Ex-cuse me?
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
Don't you throw up on boat?
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
I asked you...
Oh, yeah.
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
What's wrong honey.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
He knows better.
Whose word?
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's going to run for president.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
You want me to wait?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
No.
Wrecks.
We don't mess with accessories.
Oh... Well.
I feel really good.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Does their hair fall out?
And before?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
I'm here.
Well...How have you been?
Oh.
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
When did you think it would happen?
Oh.
Fifteen minutes?
Linnea?
Yes.
What National TV...?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
I mean...
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Pleasure
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Are we in a big hurry?
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Susanville, Soledade.
I can appreciate that.
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Whose ratings were higher?
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
Manson beat you.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Where's it parked?
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
No. Not really.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Yeah baby.
Through the power of the simple word---
Yes.
Take a wild stab!
You can't be serious?
Rockin'!
What's the travelling arrangements?
What the hell happened to you?
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Rollin'...and speed!
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Who's going to buy me a beer?
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I don't know. He's your boy.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
What d'you expect?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
No thanks.
Why did you?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
How old is your boy?
Don't push me, Duff.
What's wrong?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Don't do that!
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
A whole lot, Frankie.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Wouldn't have known you.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
No.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
It's for your own good.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Come on, Will.
What's the matter now?
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Omar--
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
You've got your orders.
The words?
The access code to your mainframe.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
Jah guides us.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Case.
Want to fucking answer them?
I thought you already left.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Where did you here that?
I know who you are.
And we really do have to talk.
Why should I want to meet him.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
How long have I been out?
How soon is soon enough?
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
I'm still going in.
Who?
Get up.
Well, do you?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Roger in Op/Ed.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
How many times have I fired her?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Oh my god.
Rob's?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Better person than I.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
It was a long time ago -
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Better than I...
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
And a gymnast!
Yoooooow.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Boys.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
That is so sad --
You ruined the whole thing!
Shock.
He sure is big, Jack...
No.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
What are you talking about?
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
You two got a thing going, or what?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You know her?
Who?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to "the other world" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Any ghosts in here?
About not finding any bogey men?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
yeah, I had a bad night.
You want to talk about it?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'll need to take her things.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
They're healing up nicely.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I know who's trying to kill you.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Do you still...see each other?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
You like gymnastics?
Those are ancient history.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Ms. Thompson.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
I can't believe I just did that.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
Take us there, Kristen.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
And what are they?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
What are you talking about?
What did you think?
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That was such a great evening.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Sorry about that...
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
Here we go.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Are you busy tonight?
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Okay.
Floppy, huh?
Why is she in a wheelchair?
What did you say?
Nothing.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
My son's name is Johnny?
Yup.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
With a goat playing a violin.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
Oh please sod off.
You and every person in this country.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Can I stay a bit longer?
I don't know what happened.
That's spectacularly unfair.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Is that right?
Does the girl have a name?
Anna Scott?
Bernie.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Working with Leonardo.
Well, thanks, that's great.
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
What's your name?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
No, it doesn't.
No, don't think I do.
May I help you, sir?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Cool, huh?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
What?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
What's going on?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
How was she?
Excuse me.
So?
Why?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Go on...
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
B-B-Billy.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
Ca-na-da...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Yeah, Mack?
They went that way.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Twenty-five dollars.
Okay, sucker.
What for?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I said out!
Hear what?
When?
Can you borrow me a dime?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
In what way?
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
How are you feeling?
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
No...
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yeah!
On what?
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
How 'bout twenty?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
I-- I must've misplaced it.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
What's mezzaluna?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
But Faith--
Hi there...
Congratulations.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
If it's any of your business, yes.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
Hey--
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
Hi.
You aren't?
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
What?
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Beautiful place...
Sure.
Wait.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
I don't know.  I don't think so.
So?...
What's he do?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
Kate, is something the matter?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
So?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
I'm hungry.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith--
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Amazing...
Whatareyoudoing?!
My God... you're right.
Uh huh.
A porco?
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Huh?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
Well, where are they?
You said they was only going to talk to him.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Terry...?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'm with Terry.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
You training to be a nun or something?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
The things that go on.
How do you like that one?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
Pigeons... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
My hand.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Am I on my feet...?
Who is he, Pop?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
He wanted to see me again.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
Your gun.
...walk?
So help me God!
I think you could have.
Really?
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
No.
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.
My favorite little cousin.
Aw, Johnny... .
Nothing happened, Johnny.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You got some nerve.
I was only talkin' to her.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
What do you mean?
I'm so frightened.
Be careful!
You do?
Ahh, she will be yours.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
I will decide the conclusion.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The time...is short.
Then why do you shake so?
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aannnnaahhnn.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Glenn Michaels.
I want to speak with you, please.
Lie face down on the floor.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He'd call every once in a while.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
You did work for Emil, right?
Go away, or I'll call the police.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
I'm a tourist.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
I don't ski.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
Hello, Daniel.
You talked to him?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Sure, Daniel.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Leave it where it is.
I could walk out of here.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Who was the friend?
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
So you've done this before, huh?
Boy, it stunk in there.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Of course I am.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
You'd probably tell me.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Unless you wanna tell me.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
A girl.
You know I saw you on the street.
Where?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Looks like tonight.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
Meaning?
Meaning time came, I left.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
What's going on, Glenn?
And is Foley a part of this?
You there?
I can tell.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
I'm looking for Maurice.
You not with probation, one of those?
He's about to.
Can we change the subject?
What're you doing at Glades?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
He waved to you?
It's possible.  Why?
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Ten gees.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
Hale-what?
What lizard?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
I didn't mean it.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
Well...sure.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Sorry to trouble you.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
What do you get for winning?
We're all going away.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
What if the Japanese did invade?
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Lucky lady. Hi.
But you love me don't you?
I know. Put Scott through college.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Want me to drive you home later?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
You really love me, don't you?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
What do you know about classical music?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
What?
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Hello, Charlie.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
For everyone.
It's Charlie!
Ssh. He's great.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
He'll win.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
What do you mean?
I'm not the maid!
What does Charlie think about that?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Okay. I promise.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What will they be made of?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Wait! I'll go with you!
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
I hear you moved into town.
That's Renee alright.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
How long ago did this guy retire?
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
What are you talking about?
So where're we going?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
What's his name?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Don't apologize for me.
Drew!
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
I'm not going to close the--
Ready for what, baby?
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
One week old.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Big trouble.
I buy that.
They sabotaged me.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What?
I'm a law suit.
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Charles. Okay. Miller?
We proceed, representing your estate.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What do you love about it?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Yes.
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Rach.
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
No.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Yes.
Is that a question?
What did you say?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
Yeah... ?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
They're coming.
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Just give me your hand.
There....
Not sure. Ten?
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Let's just be sure.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
How much you weigh, Johns?
What the hell's it matter?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
I don't suppose....
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
I would rather we all stay--
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
New Mecca....
King Tut's tomb....
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Said "looks clear."
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Not a star-jumper.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
The best. But we won't need them.
As you wish.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Where does the river lead?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
But how long is a day?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Which direction?
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Why special?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Maybe not.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
He doesn't know.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Says he can't walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
Youse so fucked up man.
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
...don't feel like it either.
Okay - got light duty, three days.
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Whew! - where that come from?
Right on.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
These two holes are yours...
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
Well..
No thanks?
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're drinking it.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
How did you meet him?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
Bad enough.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Nothing matters.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Cold?
Wonder what?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Mine?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Is it a crime?
The police always do, don't they?
I expected nothing else.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
What will they do to you?
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
We know everything.
You asked for it.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
Round of golf Saturday?
Hardly. Who's the girl?
I wouldn't know.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What do you want?
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
May you what?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
You ought to know why.
It's fine, thank you.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
What went wrong?
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
Yes, please.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
In radio we're different.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
To the airlift.
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
To the Fleet.
You approve!
Let me see.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
What about the Cromwells?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
U-huh.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
What's their program?
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
You gonna pull?
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
I'm not FBI anymore.
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
They don't go for the vault?
Sorry.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Catch of the day.
What's goin' on?
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Well, I saw you and--
Bye.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
There's no way you could know that.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
Storage, I think.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
You're not from L.A., huh?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Better believe it.
Diet coke.
Where'd you learn to do this?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
I'm sorry.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Television?
Good.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
What do you mean?
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Vivian...
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Cynthia's not coming?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Give me twenty minutes.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
I got a dress.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
I like steak.
Miss Vivian --
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
Then I'm here till I die?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
Every ship but the four you sent.
You're a silly girl.
Brides often are, I'm told.
I killed him myself.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Can you move at all?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
It never happened.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
What do I do?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
-- Fezzik, please --
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
A book?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Who gets Humperdinck?
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
Why? You can't even lift one.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
What? What?
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Slow going?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
How old were you?
I must know.
Kill me quickly.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Have fun storming the castle.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Congratulations.
"By the light, by the light,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Yes sir.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Assume away!
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But what if the play was a hit?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Yes.  We would!
Vaaaat???
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Ta.  Ta.
Wagner...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Okay.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
No.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
How early?
The following morning. Sunday.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Like what?
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
May I talk to you?
With you.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
What thing could we be in together?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Where's the old highway?
Arbogast said...
Why can't I go out there with you?
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Where could he have gone?
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I have?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
No.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Why don't you go away?
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Very early. Dawn.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
May I see your license?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
My mother is not dead!
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
...Forty thousand dollars!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Was that all?
That's it. You get it quick.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
What are you going to do?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
The wound is bleeding!
Yes!
Yes.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
I think so.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
That's the way I feel about it.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
You give me a pain!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Now don't that call for an extra!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
That's the one.
What does that prove?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
I see. Was that all she said?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
You did miss --
Could we go somewhere?
What universe are you in, Paul?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Of what?
What did it want?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
'Course it does.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
What are you going to do, Rose?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I don't know.
What do you think, Brother?
Well, it's not very plain.
Open that door, damn you!
Daddy, what's the matter?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
She's putting the titty back.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Are they polar bears, too?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
A wonderful woman, boy.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I am ahead of you.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
I am not being brutal to her!
Now you listen to me, Rose --
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Yes, sir.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
You're so sweet.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
I got an awful bad cold.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, it was a silly question.
Mine.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
You can stop it right now.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
That's them trying to kill us.
That's sick.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
You could start over again with cash like that.
He tried to kill us.
There'll be other chances.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
You know... you could say thank you.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
How'd we do?
Think Zimmermann's watching?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Good luck.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Good shot, Red Two.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
I've got something to say.
We must have a blow-out.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
I'm coming with you.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Well I want to leave.
Oh Brad.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

I just dislocated my finger.
It doesn't bother me either.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
You sure?
Why?
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I should leave.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
...Paulie. Stop now!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
...Still don't feel no heat.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Cost ya a buck.
Here -- Three minutes.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
I say ya nothin'!
That's it, I'm broke.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Yeah.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
I'm sure you are.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What was I gonna say?
How old are ya?
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Ya puttin' me on?
What's happened is freak luck.
Whatta' those?
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...Sure.
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Why?
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Check the scrawl.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Sounds like singin'.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Does it hurt?
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What the hell is that?
Doom.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
I've already seen your photographs.
Take it easy.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Good-morrow, cousin.
In love?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Good marrow, father!
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Where is my Lady's lord?
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
That dreamers often lie.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Right.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
A Plague o' both your houses.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
This is important.
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
About time!
Duty calls?
Now, what did we steal?
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I take it you still want the money...
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Created?
You should learn a little patience.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Jujitsu.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
Lovely, isn't it?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Alright, it's done.
It's my job.
Dark ops?
You think?
I'm not here very much.
So I do it.
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
I know.
Gone.  Destroyed.
It's the Irish tape we want.
I'm alright.  And you?
Doing well.  This is?
Do you have the tape?
Seven thousand...
Oh, you would have done great.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know that.
It won't work.
What makes you so sure?
I...I can't do that.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Then we're screwed.
Why don't you get to the point.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
No.  Why?
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
What's that?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
That son of a bitch.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
A week ago, at most.
I don't know.
I guess we can get started.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
I was in the neighborhood.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
And what happened?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
So someone did get away.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Who died?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Good at what?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He'll be back soon.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
You pull a muscle or something?
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Fine by me.
No.
How was the sex?
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
We made it, man.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
First class.
A little Mu-shu.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Baby Duck?
Lee!  It's him!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
This is pathetic.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
He was just doing his job.
You speak English!
I was being polite.
Shortcut?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You want more?
Excuse me?
This concrete?  This is still America.
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
What are you doing here?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
How about a lift home?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You sonuvabitch.
I do.
I would like one of my people to help.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I'm not running.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
Rub your ears.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Okay, we'll order out.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Everest.  Is that right?
Five hundred.
You humiliated me!
That was very interesting research George was doing!
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
And the church.
So am I.
Yes, I did.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
What happened at the luau?
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm just finishing up, too.
Good boy, Port Hole.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
A harmless joke.
Nope.
I love you.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
What?
Walter.
It was my mother's.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
What?
You should write something about this.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I should say something in this about magic.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
M.F.E.O.?
Okay.
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
It's me?
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
All righ...
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
What are you going to do, Sam?
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is not --
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
-- a slice of pizza --
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
This one's for both of us.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
Dad!
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Why is she bringing that bag?
Are you going with her?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
Do you like it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
How's Jonah taking it?
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
The woman question?
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Forget it.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Never... never... never!
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
A fighter, huh?
Can be what?
How do you feel?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
No ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
Bobby?
What?
Not even a guess?
How about in the house?
Yeah.
This man sounds like a real catch.
You don't understand.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
I'm kind of busy.
I need my paycheck.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Nice day
I'm hurting.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
So, why'd you want to see me?
Don't get carried away.
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
But...I've seen you.
No one ever noticed?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
No, I'm good.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Come on, guys ...
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
Shoot him.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
What're your taking down?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Murder.  Beautiful.
Danny?
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Turns out he's connected.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
A private, sir?
Good luck, John.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
As a matter of fact, I am.
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
Jackson?
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
What do you think?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
No kiddin'?
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
A half-track, anything.
Pass.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
What'd you say, Captain?
GO!
Worked, didn't it?
You get a translator, Captain?
Nope.
You think they'll be alright?
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
How about I go right, sir?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Huh?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
No, sir.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I'd like to go, sir.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Lingerie.
So, where are you from?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
That's right.
Hi.
Thanks, I like yours too.
You're sure?
Hey, sis.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
That's unlikely.
I'm gonna call her.
C'mon, just do it.
Please?
Did you sleep with her?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
I told him to be himself.
Wait a minute.
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
You like it?
Ha!
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Dad.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You're going.
Do you love him?
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Swear to god.
What am I supposed to think?
You think you know what this money is?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Are you busy on Friday?
Actually, I think that I...
I'll go.
Pardon me?
Whoa.
He does this every year?
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Job?  Being a great date.
Won't you see me later?
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Then why are you shaking?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
Your letter came yesterday.
It was wonderful.
Yeah.
Did you talk to Corey?
You told your dad?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Uh... okay... um...
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I know
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Yeah.
Now you're back.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
What's that?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
Oskar, good of you to come.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
What?
That's very generous of you.
We need to talk.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I didn't do enough.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
WHAAAATT?
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
Cotton.
I did that.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Did it?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
I could use some therapy.
She dumped me.
Yeah.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
No, it's not.
No. This is a set up.
Where's Sid?
Need some help, honey.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Miss Weathers.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
And Joel's pre-med.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
You're getting obvious.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Where is your attacker?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Can I come with her?
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
..it's really about family and tradition...
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Melinda McGraw?
I don't know.
Do I?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Four? There are five.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
The killer called her.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Jennifer needs me.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Sidney, what happened?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Geez.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Just because you knew her?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Who is this?
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
It's on the table.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
You rode your bike out there?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
Billy? What the...
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
You heard me.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Stop it!
So why did you dial it again?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't know.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
Gotta go.
What do you want?
So you better leave.
Where are you?
No...
No...
Michael... Michael Myers.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Does mom know?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Yeah.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
What were you doing out here?
Drive by patrol.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Have you contacted the bureau?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Have you talked to Cotton?
You're evil.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Uh-huh.
Don't come any closer.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Why are you doing this?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Thanks, Tatum.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I don't know...
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
For once, Stu, drop it.
Thank you.
What do you think?
Announcing what?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What are you talking about?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
You didn't know.
Where we headed?
Murderers?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Somerset...
I realize that.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
And so what?
How is this legal?
So they ran our list.
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Well... what the fuck, man?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Wait!
Put your gun down!!
This painting...
What?
How long have you lived here?
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Did their son see it happen?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
How many, would you say?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
JOINT action?
Unnt-meah!
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Talk!
Keep talking.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Yes, sir.
You want us to fire a shot if...
What you goin' to do?
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Futterman?
He just couldn't wait...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Lemme alone...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Never heard of him...
I got your boy killed.
But couldn't you...?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
I miss Tommi so much.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Oh…what have I done?
You have the money?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
We will all be put in the clink.
Most interesting.
A woman of property?
No, your marriage bed.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
I have a wonderful new play!
Cut his nose off.
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
Oh, that.
So what do we do?
It is all locked safe in here
Now where? Will?
Will! Have you finished?
By God, I wish I knew.
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
Another little problem.
Kit
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
What is the story?
Good luck with yours, Kit.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
I am, Master Shakespeare.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
You have opened the playhouses?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
The same, alas.
Oh but why "alas?"
If they find you here they will kill you.
And that was only my first try.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
When are you going to let the police know?
I don't hear this.
I don't know.
What's the problem?
How much did you pay?
You're not eating.
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
Looking for you? Yes.
Who?
Your friends.
Cover it?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, is it?
Yes.
Well, yes.
What?
Cameron?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
I think you're lying.
David hasn't seen him either.
What sort of car?
So?
Now?
What? What's wrong?
Don't look?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
He can't stay up there.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Later. But first -- him.
Now you thought of that, not me.
No.
It's the only way.
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Burglary?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Two hundred pounds?
Expecting anyone?
No one.
So let's go.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
I'm a doctor.
And he's a patient of yours?
And that's not the same thing?
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
I suppose so.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
What're you talking about, George?
Yes, but... I thought...
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
What do you expect me to do about it?
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I know.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
George --
What kind of treatment?
I hope she's all right.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Her?
Okay.
Chopped liver?
Am I what?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
No.
I am not like my mother!
I am not!
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Great.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Where do you want to do this?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
George...
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
Sit down.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- we can't now.
No you didn't.
-- oh I thought you were --
Why?
No --
Don't go, Jackie...
-- Oh yeah.
-- why did you come in today?
-- took a bus.
Jackie Shawn.
-- yes, George.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Who?
Now, George --
What?
I am?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
What!
I already said hello.
When is that?
I'll call you.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I don't want to fight, George.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
What is.
I just want to know, that's all.
I wish you'd go now.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
What did you say?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
Thank you.
Thank you.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
... this doing hair it's...
I wanna hear about it.
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Why, why do you think that is?
Have a drink.
Oh yeah...
Lester, it just happened.
All right, who're you with? Jill?

Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
I am?
Steve?
Then you were talking to him.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Oh yeah?
I am? I mean why?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Sort of.
Good for you.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
No.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Dad?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
No.  I'm just a little tired.
Dad?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Yes.
Room 237?
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Mommy...
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Shall we go into the living room?
Tony.
How did he manage to do that?
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
What do you want me to do about it?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
I'm gonna go now.
Not for me.
I don't believe they did.
Right there.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Sure, Uncle Al.
What's the money for?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Went shopping. Why?
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
What's that?
There's something else scary.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
But Uncle Al! You said-
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
You know what we're saying!
But I'm fearful!
His ashes?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
Oh my! 
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
What?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Hopeless I
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Three years.  A rookie.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Mary Clarence!
It's true!
Don't you know it!
Your name?
Very well.
Are you talking about me?
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Yeah?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
So I don't shop.
Okay -- no limo.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Vince knows you're here.
How?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Oh-huh.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Not... totally.
Well?
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
What's she doing?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Yes?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Many have.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
... Brom Bones...
Stains of blood.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Very few, if any.
Chosen me?
What is that you wear?
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
How could he?
The Western Woods.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
Small talk.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
People have put their trust in you.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Must I hear this?
To avenge his father, and the others.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
What did he say, Katrina?
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
You have any biscuits for sale?
What you got that's good to eat?
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Yeah.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
What?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
I ain't sure.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
You believe in the Bible?
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
What numbers do you punch?
I did live there in the state hospital.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I reckon I feel all right.
Do you like to play football?
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Well, I hate him.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
Why?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
No sir.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Mama?
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
You better go get your things.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I didn't aim to.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
We sure like havin' you.
Why are you here now?
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
No thank you.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
I confess.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Jesus, what happened to you?
And what about for you?
Huh?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's yours?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
They're all the same.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Ready. Any time you are.
Did you ever go back to see her?
She probably died.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You what?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A little. Not much.
What is this, some kind of joke?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
You going to sit here all day?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Well what?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I owe you something.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
I mean breakfast.
Of course. Where else?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
He's dead?
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Hey, it's you.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Celebrate? What for?
I don't know.
Hi, kid.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
Did you write that column?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
What makes you think I play?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
And her farmhouse...?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Well...
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Hey, Joe!
With you.
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
You'd better go fix it.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Have I got things to tell you!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Jerry - there's another problem.
Get me Room 414.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Anything wrong?
Not you, Sugar.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
His yacht?
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
You don't say.
Goodbye?
You're leading again.
I don't care.
And I can never have children.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Where did he conduct?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
You don't say?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Not very likely.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
You're society girls?
- opening of the Opera -
What theory?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
One of whom?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Champagne?
Look at all that silverware.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
Have you tried?
Is that anything?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
What is it?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Mineral baths - now really!
Me?
Tomorrow night?
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
What for?
Christ, Amy.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
Hey.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
She did?
Shrink, actually.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Oh, no.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Come on.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You want I nut him in the boat?
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
That's where we come from first?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Yes, mam...
No, Miss Johnson...
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
But, Charlie --
I did look, Charlie, but I--
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Where's everybody?
Miss Boatwright --
Yes, David...
David!
I don't look like no possum!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Yes, mam...
What's that you carryin'?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
Mornin'...
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
What...
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
I can't believe he's dead.
Who the hell made up that law?!
What?
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
What Cartman?!
Cartman?!
Mph rmph rm!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
You bastards.
I don't know.
What's going on, Chef?
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
That's gonna take a long time!
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Thank you, Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I'm needing lunch.
I am the dark master!
Oh.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You don't care.
What if I just left?
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Hi Wendy.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
And ze rope?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Anna...
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Of course, of course...
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
You're certain of that?
Why, didn't they say?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
It's getting hard to breathe...
I can't let you do that.
Explosive?
And what are you going to do?!
But how are you going to escape?
Thank you.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How am I supposed to know?
Baby, take it easy.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Find your bowler?
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Hey, you still here?
No kiddin'.
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
I'm not on the tour this year.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
What's it look like to you?
Don't say that about my mom!
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I gotta survive.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
My poor baby!
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
He's my father, Millie.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
What do you want with my dad?
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
You're here.
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
There's heat coming the door.
Wait a minute --
What is it?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
What team?
Maybe we shouldn't.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
You don't think weapons are important?
Damn it, Edmunds?
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
It's chipped.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
So?  What's the problem?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
A half a mile long?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
What's wrong?
Did you hear me, sir, because --
I love secrets.
Because when we get down there --
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
We have a library?
What?
Beth.
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
Forget the sub.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
I would.  But my suit --
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
You think, in the sphere --
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
P-a-r-a-s-o...
Causes sleep.
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Stop it!
Top shelf, is it?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
I never said that.
Like what?  I'm not --
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What happened to her?
Beth left?
She's cracking, Norman.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
I can't reach her.
Well, press something!
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What'd you say to him?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
No, they didn't say --
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You've heard of me?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
Well, we'll see...
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
No, not anymore.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
What do you mean?
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
What do I do?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
This isn't going to work.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
With four casualties?!
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I read you sir.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
No, this hurts.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Johnny, wait...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So ?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
No thanks, Diz.
Flip six, three hole.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Sir, thank you, sir !
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
How bad are you, pal ?
Mister Rasczak ?
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
All dead except one, sir.
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Who is V'ger?
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Yes.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
'Commander' Decker?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Viewer ahead.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Evening, Annie.
I need a typewritter.
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Great.  Who is it...?
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Because I'd met someone else.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Pelting down out there.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
What is it all about?
Morning, darling.
Water or mineral deposits.
I have to tell you something...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
This horse is booked.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I think he's moved...
I want you to hear this.
You have no right to...
I love Jewish men.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
I can't do it, Walt.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I know that...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I...
I'm only trying to...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Kiss my ass.
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Main Street.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I had a witness I would.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
What?
The writer.
Sure.
I want to make a good film.
Then you're finished in show business.
Hi!
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
That's what I said.
It's just a formality.
I don't got the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I want them thrown in jail.
...the city council...
George, that is so kind of you.
Yes, I hear it.
...the damn thing...
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
It just slipped out.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
I can't hear you.
This'll work, huh?
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
This is my house too!
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Queen of diamonds.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
That I do.  Always will.
Where Ben?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
It's not good enough.
You say that like I don't know that.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Still, please.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
You're a cross-dresser.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Moi?
And you said...?
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's just not the right time t...
My advice to you?  Don't die.
And her...?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You're lying.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
They don't hate you --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
What a great surpri...
Why in the world would she t...
Maybe he's gay.
Don't ever say that.
There are some rumors...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Thank you.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
We had to work. My family was poor.
No, Mikey.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
My baby.
He's dead.
He wasn't.
But still, you can't be sure.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Marty...
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
You know he hated my story also.
The same. Same as what?
Scooby?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Thanks.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
That's good.
Ni...
I hate reading.
I dunno...
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
But...you called.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
I know.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Is this to like get into Sundance?
I said I'll lead.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
She's still alive.
What!
How goes the roll call?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Agreed--let's move it.
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
We can't--it's power driven!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
What does that mean?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What did you say?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
Condition Red!
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I guess so.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Right.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
How long will it take to receive them all?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
War.
Check.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
What does it look like?
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Shoot, Lothar.
Master safety.
Can't "Ace" help you?
What happened?
How do you know he's dead?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Are you sure?
Maybe the warning system's out.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Can I have some?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was pretty bad, huh?
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Responsibility, progress.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
A cloud.
Oh.
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Hey, you know me.
No, no.
What, they're looking for her?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
She's dead?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Guess not.
Ah, you know people there?
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
I could.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Okay.
Hi.
He is?
Yes.
Oh, yeah?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
That's what I mean.
Mm.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
They let you out?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Oh! Trim it!
Your completely missing the point.
It was a racial incident.
Oh, yeah?
I would've stopped it.
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
New ground?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
No, I don't.
What?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Do your covers and all that shit.
'Bye, Jeff.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
I don't know.
Camel jockey.
Get off my property!
No, this has everything to do with you.
No, she was just sitting there?!
I'm always serious.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, I'm going.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
You know, my mom has this saying.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Fucking drunk, huh?
Leave him alone, Tim.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
Holy shit.
I'm in, too.
Another sex dream?
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Madonna.
Hello?
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Is that you down there?
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Uh...maybe?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
What the hell do you want?
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
What's wrong with it?
I didn't.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
As for instance?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Into what? A lampshade?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
It will?
Who's Norma?
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
What were you -- a child actress?
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
I don't want it now.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Whose?
Why did she call me?
Her own movie theatre.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
If you love me, Joe.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I will not have it butchered.
I don't know.
Don't bend back like that.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What are the notes?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
When did he say it, Norma?
Good night.
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
Madame is waiting.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let me kiss you.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
I did.
A passionfruit smoothee.
They think I have a concussion.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
Why George, are you proposing?
What about my proposal?
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
How do you know?
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
That was meant for me!
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Mr. Roebush?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
The kid needs a man to show him --
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
Who?
You...um...you never got married?
Old ties are hard to cut.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Well, aren't you excited?
Sure.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Mmmmm . . .
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Just the man I wanted to see!
I did. isn't it neat-o?
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I told you it wasn't no jive.
You want to mess with Superman?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
We've already met.
Lots of things...
How would you know?
Okay? Goodbye.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Where's the handle?
Missing????
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Where did it come from?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Really?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
I like trees.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Now This I want to hear.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Why?
Constantly.
He has powers as we do . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Free!
I really don't think . . .
Any more like you back home, Clark?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Impossible? Why?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
A hot story, huh?
Do you know where you're headed?
He may have a gun!
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
It wasn't a trick!
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Is that what they're calling him?
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
You and your real estate.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
This??
Krypton!
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
We just take it?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
What other one?
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
He will be odd, different.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
He is. Usually.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Can you really see through anything?
Do you like pink?
What's the matter, Otis?
I broke the man out of prison --
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
On radio waves?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Yes...fine.
Which clinic?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Are you sure?
Why?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What time's he coming home?
I have to.
Why?
Why did you do that, Billy?
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
You heard what Abbott said?
And winter?
It's like a song.
Yes.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
Do you have a room?
Have they ever been busted?
Tell me about it.
Almost three.
Why can't you talk to me?
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Who are you?
You can't come here.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Who did they get for that?
Are you expensive?
Are you a reporter?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Yes.
Yes.
There wasn't time?
What's so funny?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Nothing.
But Charlene...
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Will you mind your own business!
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Can I come out?  No.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Uh huh.
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
She knows now.
Sidney, I told you -
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
- He's got them on him.
I thought he would.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Back?
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
I know you do, Sidney.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
Like you?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
What chip?
Those lying motherfuckers!
We should abort.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I must be destroyed.
Are you afraid?
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
I'm very sorry.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
and totally irrelevant.
Your manner.
With more what? More what?
What museum?
I have a duty.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Your mother, too.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
I made no deal!
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
And what was that?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
And what did he say?
I'm sorry.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
I don't understand what you mean.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Yeah?
Yes.
Nope.
Sure.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
It's okay.  Forget it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Bag some Z's?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
Good fighters.
Someone?
What are you doing?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?
I can help you...
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
Now, look...
Are you finished?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
There's got to be a flashlight.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
You first.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Never did catch your name.
Right.  Call me Christy.
What is it?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
They're watching.
No!  I'm sick of this...
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Who is it?
Get us out of here...
They won't...
... what... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
We searched the house.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Underwear?
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
Why?
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
Okay.
I said I would...
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Split it?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Oh... it's a game.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Get rid of them.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Is everything alright?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
I don't like her.
What's happened...
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Uh... Nell Vance...
You're not telling us something.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
You used the wrong test.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
What'll happen to us, Nell?
What happened?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Mrs. Dudley.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Fifteen dollars.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Theo... Did you?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
That's so sad.
Anything but Japanese.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Who?
You should have let me do the talking.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Man knows what he likes.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
And that's where you met Jenny.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
You goin' back inside?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Really.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
Not her brand.
She never told Eddie, though.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
You don't seem bothered.
It didn't discourage you, though.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Up the coast.
Fancy it?
It was you.  Downtown.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah, that's right.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
So what.
There is?
I don't get it.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Where is he, then?
Ah.
Hello, Ed.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Geez, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
...Mm.
How's business, Dave?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
How much to they want, Dave?
...You know... who *who* is?
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
...Dave?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
What kind of man *are* you?
I, uh...
...What a knucklehead.
...What's so damn strange about that?
Honey.
I don't know what's going on. I--
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
It was Big Dave's.
I took Doris's keys.
So... who... who actually--
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
This hair.
...You ever wonder about it?
OK.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
...I'm Crane.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
What'd he say? Does he understand?
It better be good.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Behind you.
We need light in here, stat.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Apparently it's huge.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
What does it say?
What are we talking about here?
Curious.  There's something missing.
I don't believe it.
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
Where would we find it?
Where did you see it?
Genetic damage?
You're not.  Where is it?
That was D'Agosta.
Then it won't go after the others?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
What's to see?
All prop cars accounted for?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What music?
Thank you.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
What's he doing?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Marlon--
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
It'd be an adventure.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
Arrah!
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Truman, what about that sign?
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
What am I doing here?
Special Agent Scully --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Of what?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
You a reporter?
Who sent you?
I think you're full of shit.
How can I reach you?
I'm not sure. A virus --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Scully, I found the bomb.
Scully?
What are you implying, Scully?
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
I don't know, Mulder.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Scully --
I can't go any farther.
On whose orders?
Well, call General McAddie.
About what?
I have answers for you.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Is it cold in here?
What's wrong?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
I don't need them anymore...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
What did you see?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
You're looking well.
How is she?
What else do we do?!
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
We're both in it, Harry.
Nichts danke. Kein.
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Must you take those?
Martins.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Listen, Callaghan.
Do you see what that means?
So would I.
Bring him in.
Well?...
I suppose you don't believe me.
Didn't I?
Well, there's not much time.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Already gone.
Coffin?
Mr. Lime - yes.
Yes.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
Harry...
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Third Man.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Why?
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Two.
Bonsoir.
Hi.
No.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Fire...
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
You're not in school? What do you do?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
What assholes.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
No. What are you looking for?
And be crushed.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Why are you taking that?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
A poison...?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Listen to me....
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
How did you...?
I can't say that.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
So what Jew would you kill first?
What are you doing here?
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
That's all we've got left.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
Are you an artist?
"Do chickens give milk?"
Leary?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
Do you think I...
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Yes.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
And just where are you from?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Why?
Have the car painted.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
And where did you say you were from?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Enzo?
Everything about what?
Two years younger than you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Why?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
In my apartment?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
There won't be any need for that sir.
What do you want me to do?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
What was that!?
We do!
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
How do we bypass it?
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
I drink.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Sure!
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
The death card - -
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
It could be a man.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
To the eye? Like other men.
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
That was unfortunate.
Yes. The lipstick.
No —- not yet.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Will you please come with me?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Can it be that easy?
I can’t tell you that yet. But he’s being well looked after.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Paul Lamont...?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that?
To get me killed...?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
What about your friendly cop?
Emily...
I’m calling about the puppies.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
On the bed!
Who are you?
...On holiday?
Ever seen him before?
No... No...  I swear...
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
What kids?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
How are you, Jane?
La what?
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Piss off!
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
My rates...
Is my money in there?
Let’s go.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
You seem very sure about that.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Er... Yes...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Los Angeles?
Could that be Camden Market?
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
Three...
What sums?
Costliest!
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Of course I am, it's just that...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Well...
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
I am ready now...
Good.
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
Yes, probably... maybe...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
We want her burned as a witch!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
How old are you?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Many things...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Your majesty, I really think you...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
Good.  Where are the English?
I know...
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
The wind will be against us...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Yes, but...
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
What have you done to me?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I don't know... I thought...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Why not?
They won't come anyway.
God asked you to do something?
What signs?
So your memory's coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
Yes I am.
I need to confess.
But you already confessed this morning...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Yes, it is.
He never says his name.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
And how's Yurek?
I'll be fine.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
Halina?
I haven't seen him.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
And suppose they take the table away?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Can you help? I've no money...
Wladek! How are you?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
In the attic.
No sound at all?
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
There is something to be said for silence
The Alps.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
You've missed this bit.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Do I know any gigs?
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
You got a bag or somethin?
All of it.
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
We cleared 22 here.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They workin' for anybody?
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
I never played for winos.
Did he say he wouldn't?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Raise 300.
My end was only one.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
What the hell for?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
All right, when?
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
He'll never do it.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Any luck?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Dorothy!
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't.
He's waiting for you.
Macaulay.
Your father?
Come on in.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Only in bad weather.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Not without a warrant.
Have you got a pistol permit?
This gun yours?
Who's is it?
Who's your candidate?
What about this Nunheim?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Well....
He did!
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
What are you going to do?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
Don't you remember....
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Where's Gilbert?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
Why do you say that?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
What are you drinking?
Good. I want to talk to you.
No thanks.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
What are you going to do?
Nick!
Smart gal.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Yes.
I know I left them there.
Maybe she has.
What's in the other direction?
What are we going to do!?
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
He's not so--
For climbing.
Not much of a pass.
Epps!
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
I out rank you, that's why.
So you can give us away?
Now this is war.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
You didn't step on any mine.
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
Where the hell is it!?
Must be a compartment.
Wait.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Sure.
What do you think our chances are?
Oh, God...
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
Epps.
Yeah.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
He's not slowing.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
What is this?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
That's in two days.
We...we could go home with something else.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Epps...
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Maybe we should give him some water.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
4732...?
Now.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What?
Are you all right?
no...no, no.
It's the end.
Good Lord!
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
What?
I want you for my roommate.
You're in violation.
What?
I was lost.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
They're not here.
-Where?
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
Just do it.
Right.
What?
Would you?
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Alright!
Then why tell me?
Who are you calling, sis?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
What about the ballistics report?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Look who's talking, old man.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Yes, sir.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
Yes!
Like it?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Who?
Why should you?
Thank you.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Lily, you must listen to me.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Too much blue in crimson.
Peaches and cream.
That's too dark.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Yes.
Yes!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Ye-es?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Um-hum ...
Talk? About me--about us?
Like that?
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Then why do you want to go?
On the night table.
I don't believe it!
Giron...!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Please!  Thank you.
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I think you'd better go.
That's true.
Didn't you take it with you?
No--I'm sorry.
How much time?
You're certain?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
Bollocks.
I'm Jack Dawson.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Sure. If you like.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
A mistake?
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
I'll be right back.
I promise.
Just tell us what you can --
It's so unfair.
It would be a nice change from you.
We'll save you a place at our table.
I don't understand.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Yes--are you?
Very much--
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Don't be a c-a-t.
Don't rub it in.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Who with?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
--there's thousands of 'em!
My change.
Partners, ain't we?
On the drunk.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
How about you?
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Here you are, sir. 
How?
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Hello, Denby!
I thought I put you to bed.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Somebody's got to do it--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Get that out of your trunk.
What for?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
There you are, sir.
"Smooth's" the word.
Sure, Sis.
Telegrams.
God damn son of a...
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
How you feeling, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
You know, we might just pull this off.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
That was lovely!
You're a little touchy about it.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Oh, all right.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
That a fact?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
How did you get this number?
Sir Elliot.
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Yes -
Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
Just - say it. Say it just once.
His newspapers?
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Does this do anything?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
- Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
You are seriously deranged.
Not a lot of difference.
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I am. What do you want?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Like a veil has been lifted?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
It was nip and tuck.
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
What, are you having another party?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
What's the problem here?
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
You must have done something to her.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
When did you talk to Harry?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Yeah!
What?  What is it?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Come on, this way!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Great!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Are you peeking?
What?
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
There.
Woody?!
I can manage.
He's a pyjama case, really.
Is that all?
I finished it off.
Finn ...
Reprieve.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Victoria -
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Why does he need money?
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Did you tell Dad?
Are you going to?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
What's up?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
I get A's.  All A's.
I feel good.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
No --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
When will you do it?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Your new friends.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
Javier Rodriguez.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
You won't say anything to my parents?
What?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Like you protected Landry?
What?
Well, I've not brought them.
I'll be right after you.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Twenty thousand.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
What's your name?
Diane.
Right. You can't sleep here.
Jesus.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
Unless you get caught.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
No.
Aye.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Who wrote it?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
When are you going to visit him?
It was my fucking television.
So?
What was your price?
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Excellent.
How long is it?
Went ballistic?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Have the Klingons responded?
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
MM.?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
I did not.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
We must change our course at once.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
No conditions.



Borgus Frat.
And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Senior exec.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
For being on to Dillinger.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Well I want to communicate --
Hah.
Who is your User, program?
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Thank. you, Master Control.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
What's this for?
Just hang a minute.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
She's lying.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
No!  Never!
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
It's certainly... dramatic.
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
What'd you do, honey?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
They said you had to run out.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
Natasha?
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
I'm sorry, honey.
Yes.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
No.  But I wanted to.
God, you have great legs.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
And you've got one.
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Get going! 
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
What's going on, Harry?
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You can trust me completely.
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What is it you want me to do?
We're going to Paris?
What do you want me to do?
Hello, Alabama.
Not yet.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What kinda music do you like?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
You didn't do nothing.
"Heroes For Sale"?
Who?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
What?
I don't believe so.
I do.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Where you goin', honey?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Live with what?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Good for you.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
You're really in love, aren't you?
I certainly hope so.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
I'd fuck Elvis.
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
What?
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. Not yet.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
Where'd you come from?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
But a fuckin' baggie.
Suspect's words -
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
Sorta room-mates?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Yes.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
No, sir!
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
It's important to observe everything.
And your only goal is...???
What year do you think it is?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
I don't understand what we're doing.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
What are you talking about???
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
You're insane, Jeffrey.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
It is not.
Can I help you, sir?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You've been there?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What you want?
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
Kirin?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What's the matter?
Jake, what is that?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
It's nothing.  Really.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
You love him?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Take me with you.
John, please--
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
John . . .?
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Well, nothing.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I was hoping we could talk.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Do we shake hands?
What should I do?
Is the job done?
You didn't kill her?
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Drop it, Jake.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
You came to take my wife from me?
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I wasn't doing anything.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Christ, I don't believe this.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Give it to me!
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
You want something?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Who the hell is this!?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Hey!
What can I do for you, lad?
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
You meant it.
And what does that make you?
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Come on, Jake --
Got any requests?
Nope.  Darrell.
Harlin around?
So?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
No! Okay! Okay!
Darrell.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You love him?
No.
Walk away.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
What about us?
Because I know you're full of shit.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
My mother died in this canyon.
Harlin's.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
You got a beer?
Beck's.
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Anybody hurt?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What did I say?
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Rust?
What was that?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
Just one--
I'm not scared.
Know what?
Don't be scared.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Not really.
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
In the passenger car?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
Where is it?
He said...
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
She back in Kansas?
He admit it?
No?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
But he was called...
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Who killed him?
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
What'd Ned say?
He said that, huh?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
You missed him? You didn't...?
He ain't killed.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah, I guess so.
You... gonna take... the money?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Sally?
She gave me the evil eye.
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Shit.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
What is it, son?
Who's he?
That fella come by... Tom.
Tom?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Say, Ned... ?
I don't like the question.
How many you killed, Kid?
Maybe.
That ain't what I mean.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
I'm having a stroke.
They want more time to think about investing.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Me too.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
You have to come.
You watch your mouth.
Fenster and Hockney?
How are you, Keaton?
You know damn well, dead-man.
You set up the line-up.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
The answer is no.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Then why didn't you help him?
He wanted me to live.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
How good's your intelligence?
He was accused of jury tampering.
... tell me about this case.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What is the truth?
This is going to drive the ante up.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
Ed Concannon.
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
No further questions.
Yes.
I...
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
I read the hospital report on your client.
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
What is it?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Nothing further, your Honor...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Alito, please.
Hello, I'm calling from...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe what?
Who told you that?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
No...no...
He's not in, Sir.
Hi, Mickey ...
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
... now who is that ...?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
No.
Right.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
You use their witness.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The 'History'...?
...yeah...good...
What are you doing in New York...?
It's locked.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Yes.
A single hour.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Yes.
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
How long have you been back?
No, I'm all right.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Hello.
But you haven't lived here long.
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Dinner... and what else?
Don't go.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No? Then what?
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
I like that one.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
No, Ernie's is fine.
Why?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Yes!
I loved you, Madeleine.
This afternoon.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
My name is John Ferguson.
What?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
-- talking to you...
I hope we will, too.
Shopping?
How can you be sure?
No birds live here.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
No!
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
There's a name on the gravestone.
I'm here, I've got you...
Where's your husband?
Yes --
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
My love... because I love you.
I love you too... too late... too late...
To the church, I must go there.
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
What's tomorrow?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Easy, now.
Nothing to tell.
Where?
What have you been doing?
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
How?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
What?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
Name one.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
You're pathetic.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Bury her out in the desert.
Sun rises at 5:52.
How do you figure?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
I am not flexible on this.
We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
At the seven-eleven.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
They won't figure it out.
Don't snap at them!
They're driving me nuts!
What?
I know and I'm honored...
What.
Don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
I don't think so Boyd.
What's goosed?
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
What kind of words?
Shut up Boyd.
What did you ask me?
Say it again.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Just do it.
Isn't it a little late?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Then what do they have?
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Stop.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Are we supposed to?
May we have the rings please?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
You forgot the tent?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you dare.
He's quiet.
I'm not. What's the problem?
What kind of seats can we have?
Honey I don't have the time...
Take care of those chairs.
What are you doing?
I'm mad at you.
I'm working on it.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I won't even discuss it.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
No.
You fucked a prostitute?
It's too late.
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
But...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I love you dad.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
That's just insecurity.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Go for it.
I'm getting married...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
I think so.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
No...No.
Yeah?
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
Give them to Refugio.
Take me there.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
How long are you staying?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How did you know about that?
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
You must think I am a monster.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Let me pass!
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
You believe me, don't you?
Fifteen yards.
Ramona! Ramona!
She's mad.
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
Where's the dough?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
When you are, miss.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
How did you see me?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
On my life, I promise you I will.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I haven't been working on anything.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
You actually listen to all those tapes?
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
That's not true, Parker.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
You ready for this?
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
You're not capable of it.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Nice work.
My guess is dead.
The symphony of collision...
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
What are you saying...
What about it?
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?

It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...

What rig?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
What would do that...?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
...can we see the Kitten...?
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
Courage, Mom.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Do I know you?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
...that's what it is.
...who is this guy...?
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
W...what?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
They got him standing by.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
...what happened...?
Wake up.
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
A proud tradition.
...what do you got?
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
A wider option of what?
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
What about tipping off Yurovich?
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
About what?
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
...thanks Natalie.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Yeah, right...
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
So. See you Friday.
You really do believe in destiny?
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
He did?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
About what?  About us.
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Tony and China?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well divide 18 into three
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Are you mad at me?
I started seeing things.
Then why did you?
Your husband?
Fireball?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
You're the flower lady.
Hello?
Who?  Your husband?
Tell me.  Please.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Your house is so beautiful.
Love.
You know where she is?
What's your name?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
Telling you...
What?
Oh...
Mef?  What's Mef?
Are you okay?
It's alright.
Did I?
What are you going to do?
If she was dangerous before--
I can't believe this is happening.
I think three...
What's their name?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's okay if you're not.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Remember how we were?
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
But what if something happens?
That's...
"...for my father."
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Our house.
A flare?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Dressed?
Oh.
What?
What are you...?  No.
The accident...?
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
I felt you...looking through me...
In the living room...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
Not personally.
I don't like this, this...
Who?
So you fucked a student?!
She did it.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Huh.
Shhhh.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Then you wear it.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
When did she die...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
I don't know what you are!!!
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
And whose houses do you design...?
Too much... too fast...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
You alright...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
He's got great hands.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
I thought you were someone else
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Sugar?
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
I don't know
No she didn't...
I don't know...
then why did you marry her -
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What happened?
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Who the hell was your father?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
But that smile.
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
You guys are my parents.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
You want it in writing?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
I doubt it.
Eventually you'll let go.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Come on.
I want you to trust me.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
You're quick. I like that.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
Oh. Goodness.
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
I told you you could do it.
What kind of ideas?
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
My father must've been amazing.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
What about the blood?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Then what?
You mean he withdrew...
No.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Where's the body?
Where's Lombardo?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
Kelly's next, Gloria.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
What are you looking at?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Get off my property.
No you don't.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
So, where you off to now?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
How much?
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
I'm running away.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
There's nothing for them to get.
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Get away from me.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Yes.
But she ran away.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Jesus, man... You okay?
But I..
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
No.
Funny.  So am I.
Always hoping.  Or this...
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Aha!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Limestone quarry?
Almost?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
So... what happened?
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Can you fill me in here?
No record of him.
What's this?
Relax.  We're almost there.
Oh, thank you.
What?  President Grant is...!
My hat is off to you, sir.
Anyone?
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
This is Colonel Richards.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
I've even printed my own currency.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
When are they coming?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
They look like acorns.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I can't.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Because it's true.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Farmer.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
She said lots of thing.s
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
What do you want!
I'm all finished.  Now what?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
She needs to be changed.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
Milking?
Cows. You know, cows?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
It's been a while.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
...I want to say a thing.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Now what's the problem?
They kid a lot.
But why would they murder...
But why?
The... bullets?
What else can you do?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
That's God's way!
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You know where he is.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
What's so funny?
You are acting like one!
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
I wish dawdie was with us.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
Oh --
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
That's right.  What's she doing?
Oh --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, my!
How about a hippopotamus?
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Does it work?
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Um-hmm.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
He said his mouth.
Oh --
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
No -- No -- No -- No!
Yeah.
Here --   Come on.
Up!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
We do.
Come on -- come on --
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Let's.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Well --
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
What the hell are you talking about?
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
I was the one who brought that money in...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
Oh my God...we’re buried alive...
I can’t stay.
James...
Then take me with you.
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Now...where were we?
No!  Get me out!
What is this place?
Someone will come.
Wrong answers?
God isn't there to do it.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon, where are we?
She's with me.
His . . . whatever.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
What?
Those cars.  What year is this??
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What new information?
Where's Laurie?
I'm terribly sorry.
What does this mean?  What does it --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Looks like a diner.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
I'm from L.A.
What are you talking about?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I'm through, Xander.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
What does that mean?
For what purpose?
I don't like him being here.
What's wrong with him?
Into the Hudson?
Jean... can you?
By reading my thoughts?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
What do you want?
Who?
Where are we going?
Is it enough?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
No!
From your office, sir.
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
You have your tickets?
I hope you like large weddings.
Darling!
Love me?
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
Why did you do that?
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
Did you see anyone else down here?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Who are you talking to?
It's the only way.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Good night, Doctor.
I see what you mean.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
MMMMmmmmm!
His what??
I'm getting tired.

Another fifteen seconds to go.
Drink!
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
