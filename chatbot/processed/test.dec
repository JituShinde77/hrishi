Forget it.
That's because it's such a nice one.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Let's go.
They do not!
Who?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I did.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can we go now?
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
What?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
Why didn't you tell me?
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I just wanted --
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
And where're you going?
It's just a party. Daddy.
How many people go here?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Yeah -- we'll see.
Don't make me do it, man
Sure
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Forget her sister, then.
That's never been proven
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
Just let me sit down.
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
What are you doing here?
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
No what?
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Yeah.  I guess.
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Tumescent!
Your daughters went to the prom.
That ' s what I thought
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Then you are too ambitious.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Call them.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
My horse doesn't work.
You will regret this.
God be with us admiral.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
What's your cut?  How much?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Yes, I considered it.
No.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Yeah, right.
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm serious here.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What's your accomplishment.
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Alright.
Okay.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.  I promise.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Jesus Christ.
Not what.  Who.
Keep them out of my way.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
You stuff sausage in it.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
I want to document my trip to America.
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
What are you doing here?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
What the hell happened?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay. 
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
No. I never did, either.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
But not completely inconceivable?
Are you reasonably awake?
You're kidding.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, it is.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Thank you, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Roger.
I want to pick up my car.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I may call you worse than that.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Nothing.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
So am I.
Jack, wait...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
How would you know?
What do you want?
Sure, right.
When?
First, the money.
Give it back.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Good luck..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Does it get any better or what!
Got it...
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Exactly.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
I'm not at the hotel!
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Honey, I'm not, please...
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Tom... she's dead.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
What are you... ?
Who is Machine?
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Something like that.
What the fuck do you want from me?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Yeah... guess so.
Good for you.
How much?
Sounds good, pops.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
I don't know, where are yours?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Where does he sell it?
Alright, I get the picture.
See ya.
Great.
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
I don't understand, who are... ?
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I didn't mean to...
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
No.
Do you think the police did a good job?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Those are her belongings.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
I know.
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
It was Freddy.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
Huh?
Been having bad dreams.
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Very funny.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
That's the only reason you're alive...
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
My baby!
I don't know!
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
No shit.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You know - it <u>is</u>?
The sound again?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Why do you say that?
What about time...?
After torpedo room:  Report!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
- for horrors like yourself?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Piece of fucking cake.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Where'd you get the blood?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
Yeah.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
No what?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yes.
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Nothing.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I figured you already heard.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
The key, Wade.
Yeah.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm sorry.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Atta-go.
Sleeping.
She's coming.
Call it what you want.
Wade?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Who?
You think Jack shot him?
What about her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
For what?
Your father never means to be so...
Some kids were teasing you?
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
You read my mind.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Roger.
How many others killed?
A secret service agent. It must be.
Where are we now?
Tower, here.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Scared. We're scared.
I know he left you behind.
No.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Good. Good.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Thank you for calling the white House...
I might still have a few chips left.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I just wish it was that simple.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Felt like a large asteroid.
What is it, Mary?
You better take this.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
That was very well put, Ted.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Don't be too long.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
You have great tits.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Can I hold him?
He's a boy dog.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
You're sure?
He's carrying a bomb.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Thank you. Cream?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
No. I'm all alone.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Surely you can't be serious.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Yes?
Who wants to be first?
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Here.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Lay off, asshole.
Nice signal, dickwad!
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Nothing.
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Nothing.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Who else can I ask around here?
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Say again?  All after incinerators?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They're dead.
Cross my heart.
Yes.  A little girl.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Can we dream?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Why?
Extremely clever.
I'm so relieved.
Sir -
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Now?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Tish-I'm-tee.
You borrowed money from your mother?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
In three months! Papa.
Be careful!
Adorable!
Hey!
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Is she not here?
They say you're in debt.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Where?
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
With all my heart, Mozart.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
I think so.
You go fast!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
What for?
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Mozart -
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
You cannot say that!
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Italian?
Where?
Never mind.
What? Who the devil are you?
I can't wait.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, sir.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
No, why?
It was a wolf.
Right.
I thought you were asleep.
My best friend. My very best friend.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
I was dreaming again?
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
I'm freezing.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
Oh, come on, tell us.
No. You've had your chance.
You could have told them!
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
She says she 'likes me too much'.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
I want you to meet some people.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I'd like some tea, please.
Yeah.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Just pure luck!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Why, of course.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well—
Well, what?
Cyril!
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
Good for you. Come on.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Yes.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Why - well, I—
Directors, eh? Long faces?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
There you are.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
But I haven't . . .
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
No.
Come here, honey!
With what?
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh, Charlie again.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
He was in the bank yesterday.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
Never a good thing.
Leave me alone, Bob.
I ain't done --
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Then I love it.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
He just lost his temper a little.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
She got two of them.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Sure, cousin.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
I'm out.
Both would be nice.
The brown one.
This here is the Younger Gang!
I'd appreciate that.
What is it?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Died a hero.
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I reckoned.
You can shut up now.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Ma.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
You didn't want to farm?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Yes ma'am.
Yes?
Fair enough.
You been with a girl ever?
Not at all.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Good.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
I can't believe this.
No.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
Turn the light on.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
I never knew you smoked.
Yes, Courtney?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But what about the past? Our past?
I'm just leaving.
Nice.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
No, you...didn't?
It looks so soft.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
They know me.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Just...say...no!
Well...
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Okay. Do.
Why would I?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Oh no, I'm okay.
No, really. I'm okay.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Nice. Very nice.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Speak up. Come on.
Nobody goes there anymore.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Another Martini, Paul?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You are a fanatic.
I know, I know.
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
It was a hate crime.
So you believe me?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Great.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Prick.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Wanna be a part of history?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Oh hi.
Would you like a Coke or something?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
Nothing!
Oh. Yeah.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
What're we looking for?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You know my name.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Bring it to the other location.
What?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Speaking of which...
Hungry.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Thank you.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Right away, Exposition.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes Basil?
Groovy!
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
My mother's told me all about you.
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
A Chigro?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
I'm sure.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Shut up.
Oh, behave!
Don't worry!
I'll secure the perimeter.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Yes.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I don't want to.
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Scott.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
Black...
... death ...
Promised? Who promised?
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
He tried to warn us ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
Ring?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
Do you really think so?
And I suppose you're the knight.
As per mother's instructions.
For a man in my position --
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Any ideas?
Is that written in his shoe?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Orders.
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
I thought you didn't.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Have we been invited?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Have you any place in mind?
How did you guess?
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
I feel sure of it.
I was at Harrow ...
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Hey, man, congratulations!
Not interested.
I'm marrying Debbie.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
So does Debbie.
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Yes I did.
Thank you, sir.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
I think your dinner's burning.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
What's the matter?
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Let's see your bread.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Screw you!
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Yes.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I'd love that.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
What's with her costume?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Not likely.
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Then why did you quit?
-- I work for the city.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have a story.
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
And the putty around the door?
Then who wrote the report?
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Four months.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
And DIE!
I'm busy.
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
He's out.
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
"Don?"
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
Yes.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
How about 7 1/2?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
That 50 G could help you --
How 'bout...
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Yeah!
Delacroix.
That's mighty black of you.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
She's also moorish.
Damn skippy.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
No offense.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Mantan!!
How you sound?
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Yep, you guessed it.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I thought it was appropiate.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
He, I'm Mona.
Same thing Giuliani said.
No.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yeah.
It looks delicious.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
I just turned twenty.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
I slept too near where I fell out.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Are you trying to rap to me?
We can look out for ourselves.
Y'know what?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
Good morning.
That is none of your business.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
And so I am.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
I'll match any man with the sword.
It must have been some other gate.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Then you yield to me.
Never.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Good night, my little darling.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Tender Hegenheim.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
We found him like this --
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Tell me about them.
That'd be my reaction too --
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
Do what?
There were six of us...
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Why?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
I didn't kill him --
No. Poetic justice, though.
Mr. Hardy?
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Where are they!
Maybe --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
What kind of trouble are you in?
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Nevertheless --
What the hell are you talking about --
What are you talking about?
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Something like that. You?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
I lied. Wait for it...
Watch me.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Let's go talk to Bill...
Good idea.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
What did she look like?
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
I'll...
Go.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
I was dreaming.
That's terrible.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
The Old Lady by the swamp.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Can we talk?
It would kill you, huh?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river?
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I wasn't expecting you.
Because he's dying.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
That's not a burn.
Name it.
Ch...
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
What are you doing here?
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Tell me what he said.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
Have you got your passport?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Excuse me?
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Sometimes.
Some... What does that mean?
You...
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I don't have nothing.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
I don't want anyone to die.
It's alright.
Goodbye.
Please.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
You take her to a doctor?
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
You gonna miss your bus.
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
I don't love ya no more.
Or what? OR WHAT?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
No ma'am.
In my house, you watch that lip...
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
You can handle it.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Now, hold up.
He tapped that.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
I didn't start this, R.L.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Got in a little accident.
You need money again?
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
The hell are you talkin' about?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Let's grab some food.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
You all right?  You okay?
If you give me one.
Where would you look for the mafia?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
What's the problem here?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
There she is!
Sure.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
You were too far behind.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
So I bring some cheese?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
The cheese...
I'm taking you back.
Save it, I already took the tour.
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
Don't be.
Why me?
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
The families who control the casinos?
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
Not to be trapped.
Then go get him.
Had in mind something a little more radical.
But not to last.
What was he after?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Day after tomorrow.
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
What about a summary then.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
You sure?
Me too.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
Sorry.
I bet I would.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
I'm sorry.
You did?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
No.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
How do you know I'm not?
A tortoise.  What's that?
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Do ya?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
I just had a mental picture of...
Again.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
It's Perry!
Perry?
I can't, it's yours.
Okay!  Damn!
Thank-Q!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Why doesn't it never work out?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
This is for me.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
One who's not a mutant.
Of course.
I was wrong!!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
Wow.
Yeah.
Okay!
No way.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
I'm really sorry!
How do I leave here?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
I promise. Is that all?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
And thanks for always being happy!
Of what?
How old are you?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Just look!!
I do alright.
You're my brave boy.
Yes, ma'am.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Well, where are you --
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
To go up.
How could you?! This is just like home!
Why?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Yes, dear, I know.
Oh, my God...
Uh..he might of.
He didn't leave with them.
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Then what?
We came back to the house!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Roger, Wolf One.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Yes.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Who knows you have these?
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
THEN WHAT?
No, please. I won't.
No.
Same here.
Who's it, you mean.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
No. I should go.
Frank is coming?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Sometimes I think I do.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Mommy's here.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Okay Frank.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Mom.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
I'll get a coat for her.
Well.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Where are they?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
That's what I thought.
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Sandy?
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
This is a six-shooter.
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Ma, what's wrong?
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
me up the...
Aye.
...so that which is good may flourish
For what?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Aye.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Shit! Shit!
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You believe?
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
You think we're going to be chased?
Nothing. Go ahead.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
There's another stocker, right?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
On your marks...  Get set go.
No. We didn't.
Maybe he just went to the store.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
She needed it.
That's what she is!
Ah. Couple days ago.
I don't think you will.
As a person?
Take your second position.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Oh, I'd say about --
He stole a tractor.
No. I'm not.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Hold it.
Yes, he did.
I don't want to die.
Exactly. Woah.
It's an esoteric journey.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Let them fight.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
Sixty days?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
No.
Cuba.
Where were you?
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Is that Buckethead?
I don't know about that.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
My brother.
I'll just drive my car.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I can't believe you said that.
OK.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Where's Applejack?
I'm trying.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
What can we do?
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Nice to meet you.
There was a mistake.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Keep going...
Yes...
I killed them.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Conklin.
Who sent you to Greece?
I don't know who that is.
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- where's left to go? --
Switch! You drive!
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
What is this, a game?
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
It was in Latin, sir.
So let the council swear publicly.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Peace is made is such ways.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
They've tricked us.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Duck, here they come.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Know what?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Deal. Now read me something.
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
I'm sorry.
Oh my God oh my God...
You're such a retard!
I should have known.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
Yes, I'll bet.
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Go back to Bulgaria.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
I'm sorry. It is.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Yes, I come, I will do it.
That's all right.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Practically no one.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Thank you very much. Good day.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Oh, darling!
It doesn't matter.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Does he always leave so early?
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
We'll discuss it later.
Apparently he has the letters.
-- Yes?
He came from Paris with Rick.
What for?
Thank you. I try.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I believe you have a message for him?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What friend?
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Put that gun down.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Yeah?
No.
Good. Then have a drink.
Then don't have a drink.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Worse than Warsaw.
Do too much, I'll die.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
Why do they have to die for me?
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Nothing out there but ocean.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
No.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You want to.
I burned the Christmas tree.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
You have any children?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
I most definitely say I am.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
That's why you're a gambling man.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
What?
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Really?
"King Kong". It's really good.
Just a little privacy.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
He's leaving...
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
His father's dead, right?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Migrants?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I haven't read that.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
When will he be home, Major?
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Silicon Valley?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
So what? We hide, right?
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I can't do that.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
No thanks. I'm good.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Good boy.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Don't worry about it.
And some new clothes.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
WHAT?
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
No, I want my cut!
Then shut up.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Where the hell is she?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Sorry. What?
A little bit of both.
Can't say.
Then who's the Banker?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
No. Thanks.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I want a job, Giles.
Habib?
South African women are very sporty.
She.
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
It came my way. 450 a week.
I love you Jack, you know that.
Tension. It'll go.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Marion, stop this.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
What?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Your father?
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Turn left ahead.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
Did you solve your problems?
Over the river.
How long have you worked at the casino?
What the fuck are you talking about?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
I put them on together.
Jack.
Has he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Any exceptions?
I don't think so.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I make it six.
Five.
Yes.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Does he win?
I can see.
Bruised.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Talby, can you read me?
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
It is intuitively obvious.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Right!
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Mafhkin oble groop...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Sorry.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
How I make my living, what's your point?
What the hell are you doing?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Can I say something in my defense?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
No time.
No way.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I ain't mad at you...
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I'll make it worth your while.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
What else can we do?
I don't want to move away.
Mommy, where are you?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
It was open.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Yes on all counts.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
And you still think you can do something to change that.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
How long you and me known each other?
It's a secret.
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Pull the cash.
Tell everybody hey.
Max--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
But there's another side--
I'm a toy to her.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Whatever... stella.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
What's in Sandusky?
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Damn straight we are.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah, you did!
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
You have to do something for me first.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
Hey...
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
And what?
What?
The whole movie. Let's go.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Yes.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
He was a year ahead of us?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
That's enough.
You can suck a fuck.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
I just did.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Are we on "Cops" again?
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Shut it up, Loretta.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
What?
The bitch.
And the year before that?
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yeah.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
"My dear President"...
Is that all?
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't want him.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
What other job you got?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
Anything else? 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Are you getting tired?
Go ahead.
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Why -- why -- of course.
Perhaps he will listen to you...
How lovely.
No, I think a whiskey.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
I found it.
Did you see it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Three quarters of an hour.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
No, but I certainly shall.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
y-y-yes--
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Thank you very much.
Who are they of?
Your mother?
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Welcome home, John.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Who, Father?
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
But, Father, it IS!
What?
Yes.
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
Do you believe I love you?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Yes.
Shut up.
About raping me?
Louder.
Oh, thanks.
I didn't mean to!
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I don't know! I just did!
But...
I know. I know.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
That's my boy!
ROW!
I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
Why should WE care?
Oh... er... yes...
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
Bye... sorry...
Do what?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Your lord.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
Bastard.
What have you got there?
My brother blacksmiths!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
YOU do it!
I know, Dad.
So did your father...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
You liar!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
I don't really know how --
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Yeah.
Where are you going?
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
I'm right here.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
This is our first "date" date.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I know.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I think we should go.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Doesn't sound like me.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
Fuck you, Clementine.
It's too late.
You have to stop this!
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Nah, I don't know.
Listen, it's not erasing.
Once, maybe.
How did I look?
Then why did you ask me?
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
She came to help, Howard.
Oh dear.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Yeah.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Jesus, Patrick!
Save your breath for the climb.
The Clock People?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
About...
Well.... er...
A job for me?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
I'll get him.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Pressure?
I'm going in.
Yes, sir!
Justin.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Frozen.
...you okay?
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
Do it.
Don't... don't do this...
What are you talking about?
I'm not the Devil.
Better if I just show you.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Love to.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time to fart.
Understood.
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Come again, Skipper?
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Justin?
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
But you can breathe it.
Carbon dioxide?
Do it. Dr. Weir...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
How?
Claire is your wife?
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe you should date him.
Don't you wander off, boy.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
So are you!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Johnny.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Are you kidding?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
You need a doctor.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
You can't leave them out there.
Just find him.
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
Totally.
This is how I dress all the time.
Don't strain yourself.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
I didn't say that.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
You're fired.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Damone! You come here?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
And they don't call my parents?
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
I know.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
It was okay.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
That little prick.
Not coming? What happened?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Really?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
If you graduate.
All right, the point it is.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
No. That's okay.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Okay. Thanks.
Yes... It makes sense.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Holy shit!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Jesus.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
The cops?
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
Me?
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
Gonna stay for a couple?
And the rest of 'em?
Just move!
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Who's with me?
My truck.
Your brother, huh?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
What's going on between you two?
Open?
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
No shit.
And the last one is the...
Wait God-dammit!
GO-GO-GO!!
I'm fine, I really am.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
What did we say about lying?
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Excuse me, sir?
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
...acts. I'll relay your message.
I'm not!
What?
Frances.
Oh.
He knows, Frances.
There've been some calls.
Fired?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
You really want to go?
...Then go.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Thank you.
Fifteen.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
What?
...So you think I should go.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
What?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Will you marry me?
I don't know.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
I hope so, Frances.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
No.
And no people.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
You think I got it?
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Why are these all opened?
Then why did you bring them?
Where are you going?
Yes, Mama.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Yes...?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
I see.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
You what?
And he drove me to mine.
You speak.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
There is something I want.  A friend.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
A brain. Extremities.
She's not for you.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Is he not back yet?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I give you my soul...
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
How much longer?
Yes? And?
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
My name is Frankenstein...
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Right! Right!
Sure.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Thanks.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Rocky Road.
I mean...
That's thirty percent.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
I have no idea.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
You're a preacher?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Forever together.
Kate, Scott?
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Later.
-- you got your shower --
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Feels good.
-- This conversation is over.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
We are?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you?
Just some of the women.
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
West?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
I oughtta report you.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Chances of recovery?
This has nothing to do with you.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I'd sure like to know who.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Where's Audrey?
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Nesting?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
And you're beautiful...
It's your choice.
Not now. You got my bag?
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
I'll try.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
They are with me!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Oh.
We know.
Makes us look more American.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Just don't.
I'm... I'm shot.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
GO Commander.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Yes?
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
No, no... I'll think on it...
It's suicide.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Your last name.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Because it was on the show!
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
I... certainly, but-
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
But there it is!...
But... Inside, I have seen-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
You can oc that?
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
They always say that.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
And a French alliance?
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
You go too far, Benedict.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
We better, Congress invented him.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
I'm not sure.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Who's in command out there?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Lafayette is a child!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
Unofficially, General Greene.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
The man is a traitor!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
General Lee, sir!
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
What else?  From Virginia?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I think I will disappoint you.
Just because they are born?
Who says so?
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
So where's the money?
Who?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In the can. That the money?
What?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
The airport.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
That's right.
I'm in the movie business.
Not yet. I just started.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's right. As a matter of fact...
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
Not really.
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
Harry, look at me.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Just a thought.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
It was in the Herald.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
Wait. How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
Who told you that?
You broke in?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I want to know.
Depends, who pays?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
Come on in.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
I'm going.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
What're you crazy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Right. Wednesday.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
How about you Epps?
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
There's a charming thought.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
No. I'll try again later.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
We hit land.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Alright. I'll be right up.
Sorry.
You don't remember?
Shut up.
Leave it.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Who?
YES.
Are you still looking for a job?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
...wow...
So what do you think?
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
I figured something like that...
Then why do you hate me so much?
Shut up!
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Why?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I remember every minute of that party.
Bingo!
Just promise you'll do it.
Anthony's II!
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
Which one?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
You're insane.
What thing?
Just some people from work...
What? When did you see Josh?!
When was this?
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
It just came yesterday...
That's okay...
I know it's over, asshole, I --
What?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Jesus!
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Are you okay?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
...I better not...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
Can you at least let me in?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
No... forget it...
I wish I could see him.
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Maybe she's with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Why don't we start with that next week?
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
How; we don't know where they are?
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
So work must be going well?
But overall, you're pleased?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Then we agree. 
I assure you we came close many times-
Shhh.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
Possibly.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
That's very considerate.
...don't know...
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Didn't I do it?
That's exactly what you said last week.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Or we could do that.
Does she know anything about babies?
I'm not even good for me.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
What's the reading?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
Uuuuuuugh!!
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Are you sick, Louis?
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
I am Zuul.
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Out!
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
That would definitely explain it.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Thank you.
Are you Peter Venkman?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Close -- but definitely wrong.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
I agree.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
Life is just a state of mind.
I blame myself.
We'd better adjust our streams.
Neutronize.  System shut.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
No sense worrying about it now.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
I don't think it's Shandor.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
I'm sure, I don't know.
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
Do you want posters, too?
Until your confirmation date.
I'm serious.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
I'll nose around...
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
That's what worries me...
Only from a distance.
Yours will do!
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Of course...
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
I'd love some.
I don't know.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
But could you try?
We won't. Let's go inside.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Yes.
Did they ever find out?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
At the Zoo.
Well, I want you to leave.
What did she say?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
You really will?
I just don't think it would...
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Yes, sir.
What?
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
I am going to call the police now.
Where are you?
I'll be there in an hour.
Ahh -- thank you.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
Whatever you say, sir.
Is what a girl?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
No.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
So?
Yes.
Benjamin?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Get away from that door.
Yes.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Thank you.
Yes?
Why don't you watch?
You're welcome.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Neither.
I don't.
There isn't any.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
What?
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Not particularly.
Was he a law student at the time?
At college.
Art.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
I see.
What?
But it's not.
Then give me your word you won't.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
Very good, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Well, wait.
No -- they don't.
No.
You got me.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
You'll never be young again.
How long have we known each other now?
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Oh no.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
It's Benjamin.
Benjamin Braddock.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Not now.
The pearls are in her room.
I don't like your tone.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Not with strangers.
Have you seen it?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
You're very funny --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Because you love me -- you love me?
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
And...?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
You are beautiful!
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I'll go -- good-bye.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
I can't.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron! 
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
We could come to my room.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Telegrams?
No, doctor.
You are ill.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
A man might what?
Really?
Preysing?
Yes --
I didn't like Preysing right off.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Skiing? 
You're a little too fast.
I understand you perfectly.
Definitely off.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
I must go to England -- at once.
Well?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
Next week.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
Goodnight, Suzette.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
What -- what is it? Last night...
Go away -- go away.
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
That.
What do you want with her?
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Why? What's wrong?
Hello.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
No. And you have to be.
Sure.
Why?
That's right.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
This way's perfect.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I know you do, so that's why --
Uh-huh.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
I am in school.
Taking you for granite?
Let's find out.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
All? It ain't bad.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
I've heard the name.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
Take a hike, you mean?
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Thank you.
You up to it now?
Yes, I know, I know.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Girl scouts.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
No shit.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Why didn't you tell me?
Just get on the bus.
John...
Where'd you get it?
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
I'm okay.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
It's not going to happen.
Bye Will.
What?
Can't you?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Shit, Linda!
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Is Tim there?
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
We can light our own tree at home.
Answer what?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
He says things.  Bad things.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
God ... this can't be true.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
He's gone.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Jamie's baby ...
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
We've never met.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Let's talk about it some other time.
Months?
You ever own a motorcycle?
You told me.
When?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Sorry.
In what way, pray tell?
You never played a violin.
Me?
I know you think that.
You actually sold insurance!
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Are you--
I'll see.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College?
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
"The sting."
Mhravitch.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
It's Mom.
It's your house, Dad.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Your old beau?
Have some.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're wrong.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
That's what you're supposed to say.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Yes.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
Do it, Norbert.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
And her fiancé!
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Are you've seen it work cures?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
What brought you back?
Yes.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
Don Quixote.
The new hero is you.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
You didn't even find that out?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Stay home tonight!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I didn't know that.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I know.
Is he all right?
A what?
What was it?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
You're saying no.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
We've got to rescue him.
Penelope!  We're late!
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
We offer...
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
Yeah.
The other girl is the star?
You making a feature?
Do you know where she lives?
'Sucking off.'
You don't understand shit.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
But it's all you do.
What happened?
I can't tell you that.
Yeah.
I'll be there.
What have you found out?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
Who made it?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Where!
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Good.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know nothing, man.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
You never heard of that?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
No.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Harold Chasen.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Maude???!
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What do you mean?
But what?
What were you fighting for?
Well, I don't...
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Yodeling?
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
For you.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I have a sore throat.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To whom?
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. My uncle.
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
What else do you like?
Huh?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
What would you say?
What kind of stuff?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
War is not all black.
ZAT!
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Yes.
But wait...
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I know.
What?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
What are you talking about? Who are you?
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Oh, right --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
No. It's not.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Who wards off demons.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His what??!!
I can live with that.
I knew those men better than you did --
Each of us gets a belt.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Goodnight.
Red, I --
Marco...
Cocky.
What -- ?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
Just take it slowly.
Oh, sod you.
Hi.
Sure.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
No.
Oh.
Keep your voice down.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
What's the problem?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
The best part of ten years.
No. I'm not.
In here.
We'll move in Sunday.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know where to begin...
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
That's more like it.
That's right.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I said: I found a room.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Yeah.
I guess.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
You don't like her at all do you?
Sure.
I don't believe it.
What's the problem?
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
Can I lend you a hand?
I beg your pardon?
Play it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Oh, so what's the point then?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Laura.  Her dad died.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
So?  You even said they're good.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
That's what I said.
You can be and are wrong.
You'd love it!
Anna Moss.
Oh, hi.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
What do you mean, four more?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Okay.
Can I help you?
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Do you want me to be there?
What?
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Mission accomplished.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Enough of what?
Thank you.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Right.
And after that?
I knew this was going to happen.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
No, we...
What's the name of your label?
Sure.
Happy birthday.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
No.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
I'd rather hear yours.
Go home.
Maybe.
When you finish, what then?
Yes.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Yes.
At least.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Just a little crazy.
You killed those other two.
I haven't killed _you_.
Will I see you again?
Not power.  Not control.
I'm just curious.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
Spare me the details.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
You're not from these parts.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Aye.
Why?
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
That is not me.
Who?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Something pretty.
Far away.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
You're wrong.
Romirez is dust.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
Must he go?
Figure she's with him?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Kahn?
Sit.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
I want you to come to me.
No.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Home.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Yes, wasn't it?
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Fine.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
I don't blame them.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
How?
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
I'm beginning to realize that.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Done what?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure you can. Come on.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Keep away --
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Better.
No kidding?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
What do you mean?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
How much do you want on it?
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Where's Butch?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You got plenty of money?
It's a deal. Let me up.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
I'll have it in a minute.
Good coffee, isn't it?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
What do I know about Williams?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Fred!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
An attempt to ruin us!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Throw him out, Frank.
I won't.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Five hundred dollars.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
What are your beliefs, Earl?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
Very well, Grandpa.
Looking for shrapnel.
Sod.
You wouldn't.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
That's not the point.
Well, for the baby, really.
The sodding water table.
They might be.
Where?
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
That's it.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
He left!
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Now, what makes you think that?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I don't.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
How awesome?
Turn that fucking radio off!
Man, it's already ten thirty.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I can't believe...
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Yep, I found something.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
What should I do?
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
I guess not.
And?
It's going famously, son, famously!
Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Woof.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
I've got some things to tell you.
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
Hunh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
That's Lila?
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Yeah?
Please, honey, let me in.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
We are animals after all.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Nathan!
Do you?
Fifteen.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Really?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
Ummm. It's good.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Okay. That's fair.
Lila?
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Yep.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Poker's not your game.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
That's your problem.
I told you. I got drunk.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
I never saw you do anything else.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Where do I sign?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
I don't know.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
All right. Five hundred.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Want some free advice?
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
By all means.
Yeah, sure has.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Half and a dollar.
Ten dollars.
Heads.
Can I buy you another drink?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
You don't look like a college girl.
What do you do on the other days?
I could always get us a bottle.
No. I'll take you home.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
Leave now.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
You lived like this once.
We move.  Place to place.
We don't know that --
Who?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
Yes.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Oh, I can't remember.  But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
A toast to the end of the world.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
Love was never our problem.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
What's the bad news?
Haven't you been watching?
A countdown to what?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
So think already.
You still got the Olds?
Can't this thing go any faster?
Spunky?
This I can see.
Oh shit, we're late.
You as well.
But Mr. President...
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
Dick-weed!
No. Exotic.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I hear you.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? What are we supposed to do now? Huh? Where are we supposed to go now?
We're leaving.
Here... now.
Peace? No peace.
You are on your own?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Papers, sir. Got it here.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's war.
The Name of God...
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
I usually don't either.
Find something?
What were they looking for?
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No. You like the way I do things.
Through the library?
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
You did!!
Are you kidding? -- I made that up! You know Marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Stop! Stop!
Brody's this way.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
I was the next man.
Penitent. Penitent...
No camels!
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
As I said before, we'd be happy to escort you to Delhi.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Behind you!
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
And it had three lines painted across it?  The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
What do you mean -- how?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
First of all -- don't panic!
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
Willie!
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
Figures...
I know you did!
Try me.
Don't do that.
Who was it?
What is your name?
Shut up!
Where are we now?
Yeah.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
Then what are you stopping for?
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
You gotta help.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
We have to get out of here.
What does it say.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
What am I supposed to do?
Why not?
What is it?
You eat it.
Eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
How should I know?
Where are you staying?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Is something glinting?
Not blue enough.
Doesn't.
That place. By the window.
I don't know what's going on.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
Not her. You!
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
I don't know!
No. What will you do.
Why don't you get out of my face.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Run, stupid!
Just stay here and rest.
One of your instincts?
Never mind, just say it.
You were with GRUNER!
Probably.
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Rene?
You've changed your mind.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Dieter?
Newer, more powerful design.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
That name's familiar.
It is to me too.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Thanks.
Well...
What?
Take the card.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Sir?
Yessir...very good sir.
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
...right here too.
Haven't seen you around.
Let you leave without it.
...I...don't know.
You are.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why'd you run off?
You seemed interesting.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
Who was?
And you?
Get us one.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Can you?
Now what?
Why did you, then?
What?
Do something!
Why are you on to him?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Thank you.
Too much.
Then what are you going to do?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Catch ya' later.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Yeah?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Did you say Berman?
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
Alright. What did you think?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I'll call them, Lowell.
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
ABC...?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
What do you mean there is no family?
Liane has filed for divorce...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Poor communication skills.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
He --
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me?
Who's the pigeon?
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
We rest, Your Honor.
It was a gift from a client.
Got any symptoms?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Thanks, buddy.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
No.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
Yeah. I guess. You know --
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
No.
You just haven't met the right person.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Marylin! Listen to me.
Have you tried the duck?
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Marylin? When did I say...?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
No. Don't stop.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
No.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
No.
Miles.
Hello Marylin.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
You can't prove anything.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
That's blackmail.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Wow.
I wish I had your discipline.
Oh, God!
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
My client has ruled that out.
Ah.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
No. You're not.
Do you have it?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
"I found a million dollar baby—"
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Yes, I know—but—
The reward.
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
Stunt?
Oh, no.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Is that his name?
Are you going to see him?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
What would you like to have me do?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
All right, let it go.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
You must have me confused with—
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
That's none of your business.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
You weren't so bad yourself.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Raw?
Oh, no!
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it—
What for?
What'd you give him for the car?
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
You're forgetting you're married.
You bet I did.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Well, I am.
Not interested. 
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Oh, excuse me. 
Just your imagination.
Up yonder. See the lights?
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Huh?
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
A trumpet?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Collect.
I don't trust him.
Who?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Huh?
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Orange, New Jersey.
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Why?
Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
No, I did not.
Dave?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
And Shaw?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
What?
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I don't think so, Jim...
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
Between six and seven seconds.
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
No.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Allen Dulles?
You think there were other men involved, Russell?
No, it can't!
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
His name?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
The assassination, Jack?
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
That's it.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
Yes, Max, I understand.
You were there for me.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
She wants to make a deal.
She wants to go back to work.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
It's kind of a sports bar
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Black's fine.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
Really?
Fifteen thousand.
Surprise.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
How old's Annette?
You talk them into it?
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Has he hinted around?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
What do you do when he comes home?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
I'm sure.
I never lied to you.
I know.
We're partners.
Are you scared of me?
If I don't cooperate?
How can you help us?
What are you doing?
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Not yet.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
That's a good idea.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
If you want.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Who?
What the hell you talkin' bout?
I was there, I saw her do it.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Really, I'm impressed.
I don't like dancing.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Uh-huh?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Who was Beaumont?
Yep.
I shot her.
You know how she is.
Where's the rest of it?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
Pull the car over.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
Watcha gonna see?
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Beaumont. That's the only name I know.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
House.
I got some more business for ya.
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
What?
What does she do for you?
She got off, huh?
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You sure?
Yes.
You know it's for you.
I was gonna tell you...
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
He's around.
Take me home.
Let me out of here!
There is no out of here. You've been killed. Don't you remember?
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
No! Oh God.
Hello, Sam.
How do you know?
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Hey, wait!
Don't bother to call again, okay?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
I am.
Used you?
He told me he was going to Hell.
Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. They're tryin' to kill us. Fuck it man, we need to find out what's going on.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Who?
She hates me, Louis.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
But I see them.
New? He's been here for years.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
What's your name?
I'm not cold.
Where to?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Not to me.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
Hey, I'm not dressed.
Am I home?
Remember that.
While you were in the shower.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
How?
How do you know he's telling the truth?
I don't know you.
You've lived with me for two years.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Sit down, Jake.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You know who I am.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
They're awfully heavy.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Lennox Hospital.
A long time.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Nothin' much.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
Nope.
I just need to talk.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
The army?
I don't know. I don't know.
A car accident.
He came for me, I had to run!
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
We could convert fission transistors.
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
You just keep an eye out.
What?
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
She needs a little time.
I'm on my way.
Shut up, Thorgan!
They'll make it.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Would you?
Kay-em 14.
You killed him?
Am I in there?
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
I didn't say he was alive.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
They can deal with this sort of thing.
Three...two...one...
Old Earth?
Exactly.
What?
You got it.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
Do you see the kids?
Older, sillier.
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Swell.
Rogue?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Florida license plate.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Be careful, for chrissake.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You picked her up on the ferry.
You from around here?
Pretty stiff.
What else could've done that?
Twenty years.
Well... is everything all right?
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
I still have your virginity!
Huh?
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Mine too.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
What is your job title, exactly?
What are you talking about?
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
I rock a Harmony.
Yeah.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
Yeah?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Why? What the big deal?
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Then what's going on?
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Elbow.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
You're pregnant?
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Yeah, she does.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Unfortunately, yes.
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Touche.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Can you see it?
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Looks like it, yeah.
Have you found a place to stay?
It's a loft.
So you don't do any of those things.
It's a portfolio of my work.
Hold still.
Early! Stop!!
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Turkey mostly.
...Too bad.
Forget it.
Who?
Hell it don't...  ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
...just like that?
Why?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
I heard that.
I'm finished.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...You're hurting me...
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
What for? That guys a dick.
A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
Why?
Yep.
Yeah.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I know what you mean.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
You are?
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Casper, where is he?
Yeah.
I had a female vagina last night.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Come on. You can rave on another night.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Because, you know why. You know.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Everything is wrong.
Yeah?
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
I didn't bleed.
Good luck.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Yeah?
What happened?
Yep.
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
Four-thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nah.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Yeah.
Yes.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Homesearchers.
I'm positive.
What?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Run it down.
Maybe he's going to drug her?
Sanderson?
Find him!  I want to talk to him.
Did you know her?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
What?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
You know her?
The police haven't told you?
No!  Wait!!
No problem.  We're in.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
No prints.
We're not sure.
What about the way he arranged the body?
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
What does that mean?
You don't have a shred of evidence!
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Answer the question.
Whatever's on your mind.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
That's a very personal question.
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
She could be dead after the game.
She could be dead now.
Do you?
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
Of course.
Because I work with them.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
Because I think he's wrong.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I'm sorry.
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
Then why are you backing up?
Right.  Here!  c-4.
Because she killed herself!!
Because I know what it says.
I'm sure you are.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
Well, you're beautiful.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
I will find you. I will be with you.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
I road them often in my youth.
I don't think that.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
You will not, then?
What business?
No more, my lord - my friend. With Ergo the Magnificent by your side, your enemies are dead men.
What else is left for a man without friends.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
I know you.
To the place where Death lives.
That I promise you.
These we'll pay for.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Naturally.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Can't I come, too?
You do?
I don't think it's working.
It's right behind you.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
Food for crows.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
No. He will master the leader.
A match for your son, I think.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
Many have perished in that maze.
Yes.
It is no trickery.
Of what?
Why must you know?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You lie!
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Good.
Whoever.
Perfect.
OK.
OK.
...Because I feel it.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...Why didn't he close the window?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Three times, then two times.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Yeah, what?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
...One second.
Huh, that's good!
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
...And how much is it?
Messina.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
For a walk.  I don't know.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
How serious is it?
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
You do?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Twenty miles?  I see.
There was no card.
What?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Yes.
Then why?
I think it's a different place for each person.
About my love for her.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Yeah!
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Where?
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
What, come on?
I do.
Where am I?
Mr. Parker, I'm supposed to give you your fish sticks.
What do you want?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
No -- S.E.R.A.
I sometimes fade out.
Thank you. What time is it?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
What do you mean?
We?
No... we already talked about that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I am lonely, Yuri.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
It's me, Yuri.
Sera... please go.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
I'll take that as a no.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
No.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Where you got in the shower.
You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?
Thank you!
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
You know her?
Your scrunchie?
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
Maybe not to your face...
You're serious?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
I don't --  Do that stuff.
For a butt-head? Yes.
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
What, like on va-kay?
I do.
Maybe she found him like that.
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
Of course.
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Well, yeah, but --
Where?
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
We go out, smash 'em now?
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
But I'm hideous!
Grotesque... monstrous...
To be my bride, of course.
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
What will become of me then?
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
I see...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Or looked so beautiful...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Flozen foleva not good.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Faerie ring?
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Aye!  That too.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Hurry up!
I could have struck off his head just now!
Sapphire!
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Never.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What shall we do?
Be patient.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
They tricked you.
Its powers are strong.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Only what's right...
What?
And I... love you...
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
As fair as me?
You'll visit again?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I pray God grants it me.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Do I not please you, Jack?
And am I not fair?
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
How so?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Heading north still?
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
In a dream.
Red.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I can't even take a shower here.
We're not gonna do anything.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
A sink?
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
how much weight have you lost?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
Oh...okay.
I'm sorry.
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Goodnight.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
No you don't.
It bugs me.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
The gloves on the table are for you.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
What I'm not.
That's not true.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
I haven't been touched in years.
I want you to find someone for me.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
I was parked in day parking.
The garage.
When's school over?
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Sam's favorite.
Do you remember?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
You're not well.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I can hire workers to help me.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I need to know.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Left you?
Nothing.
Should I?
What are you doing home?
Please don't leave me.
I feel in love with George again.
Hey.
No.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Can we really help build a house?
In the bedroom.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
She got married last month.
Married?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
That's right, a loan officer.
You need collateral.
My daddy gave me this watch.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
What gave you that idea?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He does it all by himself.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Forget it.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do you want, Claude?
Absolutely. The map is very clear.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
I can't eat it with mustard.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
They're touching.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
What were they, bootleggers?
Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
It's not me, moron.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Definitely.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
We know where to find Nicky.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'll just go to Heaven.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
School?
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
I think I'm floating.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
That was Cassius!
No.
I don't know.
A black guy?
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
All right -- what are you?
Your turn.
You're a beautiful pair.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
I am.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
You prefer women?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
It's different now. Help me.
I don't..
Of course --
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I -- I can't.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
Don't ever let go.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
It could be...
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
All this. All of it.
What's that?
It's all right with me. Is he here?
Have any other people ever passed through?
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
I don't think so.
What do you mean by that?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Or something.
Or not so recently?
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Over there.
We should stop seeing each other.
What deal?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Alice?
Alice?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Did you tell the police this?
The wife killer?
Out in back.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
The first night... Not the last two.
No, no. I want to go in.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Does it say anything on the tape?
Maybe.
When you didn't come to the club.
Called? When?
What?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
No... of course not.
The heart, I guess.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
At sixty?
Pornos?
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
You want some company?
Sure.
No... I told you.
Yeah.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Oh, really?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Okay, Lovey.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Why, you look beautiful.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Centuries.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
You've been lying to us ever since we got here! Apparently it's worked with some people. Perhaps it's because they lack the courage to do anything about it. But not me, Chang. You're up against the wrong man. I'll get out of here, if I have to blow this fantastic place into the valley! I'll get out—porters or no porters!
Father Perrault is dead.
Are you the High Lama?
Oh, the girl at the piano?
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Is that all my story meant to you?
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
She came here in 1888!
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
Come on! We're wasting time!
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
My name's Sondra.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You'll wait till you rot!
The hell were you thinking?
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
All the time, sir.
You do?
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
You heard me.  You two, especially.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Hold it.
There's a god damn good reason.
And what's this ... ?
You think that's what's-happening?
The Pentagon.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
For how long?
All of it?
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Do have any idea what I just said?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Can you see the balloon man?
What is it?
Someplace safe.
I have to go back.
Oh, Jesus...
I know... I do, too...
We know each other?
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Hang on, Lamar --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
You can't run --
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Now look at him...
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
Oh... Hi, John.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
So?
Then take her to Radio Shack.
I guess that's all of it.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Once I even told him I loved him.
NO!
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Not if I stay away from him.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
-- and then walk out.
The female.
Oh, God, what did you do?
I don't know who that is.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
I wanna kill my boss.
Right here.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
Knott!
Who?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
Yes.
But John was with him at the pool?
Tell me how all this works.
So?
What if I gave you forty?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I'll support you.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
I want you to take her with you.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Get your hands off of her.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
He must have that shit troughed.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
She was fast, huh?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You told him you liked him.
Where's the drop?
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Thanks.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I got no idea.
I will.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
He implied it.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Sorry coach.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Forty-six.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
What's up?
He wants to see us now.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
The what?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We don't need guns.
Wanna bet?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Fuck...
You want your surprise?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Where do you live?
It means you got a gun?
You really in trouble?
Stop.
You want another drink?
Yeah.
You know my pager number?
Keys.
Yes.
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
Scotland.
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
He had it coming.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
I'm there, daddy. Wheww. I'm cool enough to kill.
Bet you are.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
What you talking?
You owe me six big ones.
You know it.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Man, what do you want?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Elijah who?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Okay, okay. Show me, man.
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Next week, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
If you want to tell me.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Delicious.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
I'm not made of glass.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
Betty it's me. It's me.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
Down front as always.
Sure, man.
If she got eyes, she do.
I mean it's late, baby.
Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
500.
Please make way, please --
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
Yes sir.
Allah will provide.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[Why?]
[I have a friend there.]
I have connections.
Give me the address.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Correct!]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
And what if amateurs try it?
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I'm here.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
How long you staying, Crease?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Yeah. Two or three.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Are you afraid of me?
Could I stop you?
You don't drink like you used to.
Still not a question.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
You think too much?
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
Planned what?
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Last night. Do you know something?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[Yes.]
[No. Why?]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
Two tourists who never went home.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Down there. That little one there.
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Who told you that?
Who?
When was this?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Yes, I know.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
All right.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Sure, great if you ain't married.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
Sure.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She didn't look Italian to me.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
Hospital.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No.  Or why you should.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
What's that?
What do you think, Trapper?
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
People will talk.
Ravenous. What about you?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
C-A-M-E-M...?
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Duke...
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Splendid, sir. No problems.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
I out-coached that General Hammond.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
You got me.
No.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
How much money do you get?
A hundred dollars!
Yes. The John Doe Party.
All set, Ann?
Oh.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
You bet I will, Ma.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
Thank you.
That's—
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
. . . Tubby?
Who are they?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
A gag. A gag!
Sure, you are.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Yeah, you bet!
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
No, I didn't.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
Thanks.
Did you want to see her about something important?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Okay.
Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
You want me to go up with you?
Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
Is that where you're family lives?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Johnny who?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Roper, we're into it...
No. You just do shit for me right now.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
You'd never been out of New York?
No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
Do you really?
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Yes.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
You're crazy.
Pull up alongside.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
If you did, you never showed it.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I can't do that.
Who's running it!
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Yes...
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
-- He will.
New York.
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
He wouldn't say.
That's right.
Good question.
Times Square.
Insurance.
-- The inside?
But you were with me.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
-- Waiter.
Speed?
There should be a way to open it.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
Ryan's Comet!!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
How about Major Moron?
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
What's going on?!
The goddamned bastards.
Life knocked me back.
I guess I am. Just a little.
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
How's Bugsy doin'?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
You got something to hide?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
I told you twenty!
Ya piss like a man.
See if these two are my friends.
Never threaten me, Boss.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
I got partners.
They do what I tell 'em.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Okay. I'm listening.
Shuddup.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Kill them! Kill them!
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Anything!
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Uhh - martini?
<u>Why</u>??
Bend over?
Death! Thank you!
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Tell me what?
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
All right. You can come.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
What pictures?
Mother!
But I was dusting.
You know, you never tell me anything.
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
What happened?
And where is she?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
So, you come here all by yourself?
Yeah.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Yeah.
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Now, pet--  Jim!
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Oh--Jim!
Aw--
Is *what* getting me down?
Than what?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
"Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs in your veins, Jeff. You're just like your father.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
*No*!
No!
Pleased to meet you, sir.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Oh, but this one is so simple.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
*This* is.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Have you always had to--work?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
No--
Not another bill?
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Oh--Saunders--
A camp! Well!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Then you *did* say it.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
That's dynamite, Joe!
Okay. See you here.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
No?
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
He's lost complete faith in me--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did *anything*, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
You can't say *that* to--
Anything *better* to offer?
Maybe he won't get up.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Uh-huh.
Always.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes!
What's that got to do with it?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
Do you always wear your hair like that?
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
What's that?
Nothing.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
With pay!
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
With pay!  She is out the door.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
All set.
Yes.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Who - me? No.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Why should you?
Huh?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Arthur wants to quit!
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Oh, Mr. Deeds—
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Oh. That.
Now wait a minute, buddy—
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
But she's on the telephone—
Yeah.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
No!  What do you want!!
Uh-huh. What are they?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Mr. Follett.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I never said that.
And the experiment is in here?
Mr. Gilroy --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
You've done well.
A little.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
-- Go on!
Sure I can, Lionel.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Is she a friend of yours?
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Oh... not a real doctor.
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
Why don't you tell me?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
What would you do?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Really? What would it take?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
And he's where?
Yeah?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
I don't follow you.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
What?
Weekly or monthly?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
True. Should we stop them?
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
Nah... scotch.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
You're completely reliable.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Exactly --
Try me.
Correct, And that's when --
Twenty.
You swear?
For entering the afterlife.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
Because that's my name.
That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
What's it look like!?
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
And what's that?
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Why bother?
Frankenstein!
Alone tonight?
Every night.
That was easy. 
What?
But I just don't feel it.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
So you're chicken?
But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
The Eradicators!
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
I use it... to fight evil.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Are you sure he's still alive?
With or without him, we gotta go!
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Properly arranged, yes.
These are odds of 8 to 1.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
That is incredible.
Yes, sire?
Oh, shit, that's not right.
No, sir, none at all.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
I am, Citizen.  Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
Oh...?
Yes, it must be.
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
When is she supposed to return?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
No.
Were they pretty?
Yes.
I cannot promise you that.
I don't understand you.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You mean about my wife?!  You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
I couldn't face telling you.
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
Yes, he has.
That is correct.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Good.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
What?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You don't know Baby D.
You already in.
Me too.
I just wanted to give you this.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Come on.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
I don't have no damn cover.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Let it go, Roach, trust me.
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I'll take you later.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
What's the matter?
Elroy.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
'S okay. What do you think?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Same to you.
Yes.
I'd like to know what...
Good.
The gun...
Me?
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I think you're right.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
All right. Kisses to you.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
What?
Everybody does?
I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
No, Ben.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Don't!
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
About what!
Walt!
A man of the Cloth?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
There's something else.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
There! What's so hard about that!
Blue men.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
No, that's just it. No.
She talks to herself.
Dead. 
He ain't my Dad.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Is that all?
It -- she --
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Now it's your turn.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Ahh!
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
Get up.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
This man down at the Drugstore...
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
No.
What happens if they don't do that?
The killer.
What!?
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
I don't mean her --
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
So he's alive?
Naturally, Comrade.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Yes.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
I think I need my glasses.
The Duchess...
The former Duchess!
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Get out of here!
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
You mean you are deserting Russia?
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
We did it with the best intentions...
Au revoir.
You want me to go in there?
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
On what?
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
And where are we?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Suppress it.
Yes, it is.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
He takes good care of that.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
That is correct.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
Don't do it, please.
Wounded? How?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
Let's forget that we ever met.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
On which boat?
Do you like Scotch stories?
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
Much happier.
Radio! What is radio?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Oh, yes.
What does he say?
No... please...
Months, Swana.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Do you expect me to believe that?
What?
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I must ask you to leave.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I must insist that you leave.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
That depends on the tip.
No.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
Where is that?
You did say it, sir.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
I like that.  That's a solution.
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Well, no place where they speak English.  That way he can always say he was misquoted.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Cox!  Fire him.
I had no knowledge of the cover-up until John Dean told me about it on March twenty-first.  And I did not intend that payment to Hunt or anyone else be made ...
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Money.  Follow the money.
Run 'em over.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
Why me?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard.  Strength in this life.  Happiness in the next.
What'd you say?
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
What?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
No.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Winning?
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Agreed.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
I was the lesser of two evils.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
Ernie Davis.
Elvis I like, too.
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
It's over, Dick.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
When?
And what am I doing?
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Didn't know there was any.
In Angola. Yeah.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Oh yes.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
Nothin'?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
He won't neither. He never has.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
I can't plan your day.
To your husband.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Goin' out.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I shall return.
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I mean the nature of you.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
Screwgie.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
Do you know where I'm going?
All right.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
What way would that be?
I seen you was from Dallas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
See about closing.
Sir?
Well...
I could come back then.
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
Just call it.
No.
All right. Heads then.
What kind of tent?
The kind with the most poles.
What room?
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Okay.
The option.
Another additional.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
That's got two double beds.
I got beers in my room.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
No sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
It wasn't a woman.
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Tell him what you told me.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
No, I was just... How you doing?
Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I'd rather not...
No... what about your sister?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
You're late, Eric.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Ad lib?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Did you love it?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Worse.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
How many men have I talked to?
What? Where was he?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Fine.
He is real.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Where are you going?
I have to leave now.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
If we're for real?
...and put them in your mouth.
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Hell of a way to die.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
I'm not telling.
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
She's a lesbian.
Where's Tommy?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Oh my God!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Helluva awgazation.
Powas p'suasion.
Vernon T. Waldrip.
No weddin'.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
Don't I know it.
It was in his bureau.
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
Well, but Pete...
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
I wrote. Not every week...
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
I know.
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
Before that.
No, sir.
Zack, don't!
I said, come here!
We don't have to talk at all.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Come on. Let's go dance.
I got my foot on the floor.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
I haven't made up my mind.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Do you go to school?
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Forget it. Just get out of here.
I'll get it if you want.
I don't want you to move.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I don't know where that is.
Why?
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
Yes.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
You're an idiot.
The fuck did you bring a gun for?
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Hey.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
I don't get it.
What do you want?
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
Open it.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
478...
PANIC ROOM!
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Huh uh.
Get the fuck out of my house!
Little bit.  Yeah.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
I saw something, I saw...
No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen.
I'm sorry, Mom.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Damn straight.
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Naw... I gotta...
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Can you make a deal with them?
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
No sir he didn't.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We're like policing the police.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
What are you saying?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
Late summer.
Uh... uh... I...
You call that a compliment?
It's a start.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
What officers?
Yes, sir.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
It's safer if we stay together.
Yes, sir.  My father taught me.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
She is.  Don't go in there.
You know what happened.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I don't care.  I hate him.
You don't hate him.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
That's a damn long time...
Thank you.
Where is he now?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Four, five miles.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But father, they might come this way.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Well, I thought it was safe--
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
You believe in it.
I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and--
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Not at all.
Allman Brothers.
Sure.
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
You'll see before long. Let's go.
This time I mean it.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
This babe has said enough.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
We got that part.  Anything else?
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
All right then.
Aye, for us there is.
Boy overboard!
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I know where your heart truly lies.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
Me!
You're in league with Barbossa!
The trees are taller.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
How did he get off the island?
Sorry, I didn't know.
Smith.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
Move!
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Because you're a pirate.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
That's not true.
I swear, you look just like him.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
No.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
What I asked you earlier?
The nanobot is gone.
Donated to science.  Perfect.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
The replicators?
Opportunity?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
The big house?
Right.  You predicted it.
What happened to it?
Got it.
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Probably the caffeine.
No problem.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Like a glove.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
You were looking for us?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
No - give you another guess.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
What are you talking about?
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Look! Look! The front page!
Yale '21, I believe.
Is that so?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
I'm afraid.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Why not?
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
That's so.
A what?
My play.
I'm not quitting!
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
You're my what?
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Nothing.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Here you are.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Double strength!
Get out of here.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
You try it.
No, sir!
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Yes.
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
Sure.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I had to say goodbye.
I won't.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
Yes she is.
Um ... It's ...
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
It is?
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
That's not going to happen!
Yes I did.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
It was accessible to everyone.
The basketball team?
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
To who?
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
He won't notice anyway.
Jen please ...
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Wow.
Yes.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Oh ... Hi.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Scout?
Nice ... Nice ...
What department store did they go to?
Ooomph?
COME BACK!!!
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Look ...
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
I understand.
Yeah ...
Yeah ...
Why?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
What happened?
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
No, no, no.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
I'm trying to be your friend.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Hi, is this Jack?
Sure.
Are your pants off?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
You're going to work now?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
No.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Are you guys hurt?
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
About six months.
Yeah.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Yeah?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
...yes I did...?
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
Hi.
Really?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
yeah.
It's so nice.
For what?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Thank you.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
It takes time to process --
You're goin' on a trip?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
You have an ATM?
No.
Seriously.
I know.
I know.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
Yeah.
Bye, Barry.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
Yes, Abbe?
Why not?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
THEN BUGGER ME!
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Why was it you never took her by force?
Of course.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Well...?
Oh indeed?
You'd suffer in her stead?
How is the patient faring?
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Enough!
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Fiendishly so.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
....shame on you, truly...
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
But it's just begun --
You're just scared.
Houdini mice.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
And director.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Randolph!
Uh-hub.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
Pops
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I don't want you to--
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
No -- no -- I mean--
Uh-huh
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Like a bug.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
The great Spanish bullfighter
The old man has his own way of doing things
Orson, please ... it's too bright
We're doing Hearst.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
She was . . . innocent
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
I'm sorry.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
This ain't George's doing--!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Herman.
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
Again.
Ah, it's a grand title.
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
What?
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
None of your fuckin' business.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Sure. What is it?
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You want the title shot or not?
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
C'mon, Joey.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
What do you mean, "you"?
Did you ever fuck my wife?
At night?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
What does that mean?
It's OK.
Who asked you?
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
You're not interested in him?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
What'd you see?
What're you talking about?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
No, not that.
Why don't you just call him?
Sure, what else is new?
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
All right, just don't make any noise.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Goodnight.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Who left -- where?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
If possible -- both.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
For what?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Jeff --
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Did you get my note?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Well, I only quote from the best.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  If only she was ordinary.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Isn't he a salesman?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
And you love life?
Only because it's expected of her.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Make the one you want.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
I think it's enchanting.
If anything, I'm making it sound good.  Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Tell me about it.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
What are you getting at?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Yeah.
Down in back.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
You're absolutely right!
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
That's right!
What's that pounding?
Do you hear from him, son?
Head-shrinker?
No.  I don't think so--
They're still there!
No.  It's okay.
I'm here.  Shut up.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
I'm what?  What?
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Get away from me!
No.  At dawn.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You sure?
They like you.  Okay?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
I don't know why--!
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
She eats him alive and he takes it.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See, I'm new.
Yeah--why--
A what?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I'm never going back.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You smell like baby powder.
We have to go back!
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
He hates me.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
I didn't want to stop.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
Beauty and fragrances.
Nick, please, it's me --
You told him about Nick's letters.
No!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
We? What "we"...
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What's her greatest fear?
The hell you don't.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
I said, who the hell made the map?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
No.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Five years. Since it opened.
How long ago was your makeover?
My what?!
What?
Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
I'm just saying.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Ash... Ashley...
She set them up. All of them.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
But... I had a five...
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Bullshit.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
Yeah.
A little.
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Give me my book.
What for?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Correct.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I don't believe in it.
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
That's not correct.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
He ain't dead.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Of course.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
You takin' his side?
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
What are you gonna do about him?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Maybe he did.
Nobody. The light was bad.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Yeah.
They're stragglin'.
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
Thanks.
That's fine.
You're not going out to look for them?
You don't mean that Clay.
All right -- it's said!
She's a friend -- took off this morning sort of sudden while I wasn't around.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
At the ranch maybe?
Why?
How'd you happen to miss?
Finished, son?
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
You want to split up? --
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
What's there to be fair about?
I don't care.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
It isn't that --
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
I don't care what he thinks.
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I feel good anyways.
And you've got me all figured out?
Do I know you?
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Okay.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
So, I guess I can go now.
No, stay.
Sure. We can practice talking.
It looks like the furnace.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
That's what your man is supposed to do.
I think so.
She killed herself a week before he died.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
We? What do you mean... we?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
Any of them hot?
Professor!
Even in the bathroom?
No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
And sexy.
Just a little Rogaine.
That's right.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
What?
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
He certainly drives like a jerk.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
Oh Mom...
That's right.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Oooohhhh.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
I beg your pardon?
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
What do you mean, you're not sure?!
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
...Browsing.
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Where?
What sort of danger?
As a man, you distrust me —- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
What were you talking about?
Yes.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Not from me.
Yes.
But you're always at the library.
I don't know.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Devil worshippers!
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
No. She's no longer under my care.
No, she's with her sister,
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
She's not been here for a long time.
Please.
What?
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Kids? What about them?
You're in therapy?
So you don't believe in therapy?
You had sex with you therapist?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Basically, yes.
Are you in the middle of something?
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not really.
Why not?
This is just... so...
Yes.
That's a good question.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Does he go down on you?
Absolutely not.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Do you want me to stop?
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
How come?
And you feel the same way with John?
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
I'm babbling.
That's very flattering.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
I don't know. Possibly.
But that was part of it?
Because.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
Who'd you have lunch with?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Loud.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Yes.
You bitch. I knew it.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why, so you can go after him?
I have a pretty good idea.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I just thought it might --
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Because I never got around to it.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Questions about sex.
No, but I did.
Why?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
She still is.
She didn't give you my address?
Doing what?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Hi.
I'd like to make another tape.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
No.
Who said I was jealous?
Nothing wrong with trying.
You told Ann about this?
I just... Ann is very...
Look, are we going to do it or not?
How about straightening up the living room?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
You were prying before?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Brian Kirkland, please.
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
One moment.
Was he nice to you?
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Uh, OK. Sure.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
Nick, you're so strange...
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Gonna cut me open?
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
So who changes?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
OK. I'll think about it.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
I don't get it.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Fools!
I got it!  I got it!!!
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
But I don't need treadment.
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Flavors!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Gary.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Not so bad yourself.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I'm working on it.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
And get your bone smooched.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
When do we get to drink it?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Then it's a good thing.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
She works for tips!
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
We were supposed to play golf.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What? Of course I like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Oh yeah. Sure.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
What exactly are we going to do?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Yeah.
Hrnrnrn?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Whatever. Sorry.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
Okay.
So what's happening with your book?
I am.
I guess.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
French or American?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Does she ever answer back?
...Tell Graham --
Explain noises.
I heard.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
Me too.
They tell you everything in this book.
Bimboo?
Dad.
Sounds like a virus.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Pinned? What does that mean?
They'll find a way in.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
You'll never make it.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Right.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
That I do.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
You got no idea what they were after?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
Where's Turley?
Women?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
I understand.
You haven't got any money.
What about the law?
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
Because they enjoy it.
You're right.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
I told you this was a sweet set-up.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Paden.
I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I thought you two would get along.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Almost right.
If it's on the page...
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
She doesn't want pity.
Thank you.
Excuse me?  Start?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
I want you back too, Viktor.
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Where are you?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
-- Please, get away from me.
You want me to call Security?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
-- We call them "vactors".
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
You saw that?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
This week anyhow.
Is she here tonight?
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
They are alive, Sayer.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Don't you?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
I told you what I want.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
No.
I guess she did.
Oh.
Maybe.
Tell you my secrets.
They scare me too sometimes.
Dead people.
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
Stop it!
How'd he know I'd come?
Tramp.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
You know who I am. You invited me.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
"Blood?"
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Down boy.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Nothing to tell.
Then why go back now?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
It's you. You and your father.
What'll we do?
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
Aspirin.
We're coming your way, man!
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Last year, this was a new rig.
You paying for the gas?
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Would I lie to you?
Like what?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Uh-oh.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Yeah?
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Hey...
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Another time.
How'd you know?
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
Not for long, you ain't.
What does the old Timex say?
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
You okay?
Who's Fred?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
That's correct.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
And that didn't seem odd to you?
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I left him a message.
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
-- no, we need to handle it now.
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- okay, g'head --
Wow.
A million flat.
For real?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
Can it work?
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
That's fantastic.
Will she come back?
To who?
Who are you trying to convince?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
To calm your anxiety.
I want you inside me right now.
Better.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Then it's God, right?
You still don't believe in God?
You don't know?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
I'm glad.
Why did she do it?
It's all right.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Don't call me that.
Chris --
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
I can't --
Am I really her?
When?
You must have been dreaming.
Why do you say that?
We want to talk freely.
It's an experiment.
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Hello, Win.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
There's a phone in the car.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
Sooner, the better.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
And "is"...?
You don't like him, do you?
What's to like?
You could do better.
Sleep good.
I can't open it.
Claire, will you calm down?
They called here after you left...
She's okay.  Everything's okay...
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Nothing.
What?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
What about when she identifies him?!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Is she injured?
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
How about dinner tonight?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Take care, pal.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
He knew.
Some things you should say anyway.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What?
Some prep school thing.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
That wasn't clever.  That was just nasty.
Do you mind if I come too?
Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is… what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
I know him.
Any sign of our friend?
That's the understatement of the year.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Aunt May, what happened?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
I don't care.  Cretin.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Imagine how I feel.
Is you all good Nazis?
Get going on the trap door.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
That's right.
And maybe a little something else?
Thanks.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Don't wear it out!
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
You are talking crazy!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What exactly is he charged with?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Say, Schulz --
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
Where'd that come from?
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
You clocked him! Why don't I clock you?
So what? There's other women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
She'll never forgive me!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
No. I want to draw.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Why the south latrine?
A little weak today.
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
You told them, Hoffy.
You did!
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
I do not want those cigarettes.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
On screen.
Beam them directly to Sickbay.
Can I?
I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
It's our pleasure.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
A photon torpedo?
What do you want?
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Aye, aye, sir.  Take the wheel, Commander.
They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Thank you.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes. He has a long journey ahead.
Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Response?
Locate.
It's a little early to celebrate.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Not exactly.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
None that I can detect, sir.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Come on!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Any time.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
... The needs of the few...
... Or the one.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Say the wrong thing, Torg, and I will kill you too!

We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
It's like the Garden of Eden...
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Who --
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Doctor Marcus!
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Admiral --
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Aye sir --
Steady as you go...
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Yes, sir.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Try again.
I'll try, Captain.
Ready, sir.
He's very human.
By the book...
Where must you go?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Understood. What is your plan?
Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
Or believe, I'll bet.
How will that be done, exactly?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
Thank you, Admiral.
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
Surely you can be more specific...
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
How do you know this...?
Yes.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
... I see.
The tank will be finished by morning...
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Picture, please.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Yes, sir.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
I'll have to re-energize.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Millions?
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
There are caves in those mountains.
This way!
Really?
My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change.  I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet...
Data doesn't breathe.
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
What if he doesn't realize something's happening...  Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
If it works you mean.
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
Deck ten.
Would you like something to eat?
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left...  "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..."
"Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind...
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
I'm your creator now.
Vulcan?
What?
Contact Starfleet Command.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
One minute to warp threshold...
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Active.
You don't sound French.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
I can try.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Onscreen.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Destroy the deflector dish.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Commander... we have a problem.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
You may need assistance, doctor...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
How can I trust --
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Well, I -
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up, Captain --?
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
It IS possible.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Captain, if --
Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse power...
You hear that?
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
They're dying.
Spock, you want to know something?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Sir?
No, sir.
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
That could take hours!
I know precisely where he'll be.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
No.
How long is that?
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There’s no crying in Starfleet.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Yes.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
And this makes you "sad"?
You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
To new worlds...
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
Aye, sir... This way.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Ready, Captain.
Fire!
Of you?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Emergency force fields are holding.
Do you have a moment, sir?
Make it so.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
We’ve got him!
That's an order, Commander.
On screen.

Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
If you don't mind.
On screen.
Your new chair, sir.
Thank you, sir...
Counselor?
Praetor Shinzon?
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
What happened?
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Yes.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
New worlds.
Age before rank, Jean Luc.
I know.
In time.
You're not Reman.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
I see more than what you are.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
It is... invigorating.
Should I raise shields?
Seven minutes.
You heard me.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I have a purpose.
Now go. I have some personal business.
No, we can handle this.
Benny, this is me. I'm going to take a look.
I understand.
You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
Where's that?
They must have picked it up in space.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't like it, George...
Watch it. They're coming out.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Good.
Coupons.
This car runs on gas.
Closed?
I am Jenny Haydn.
You want to try it?
Shit!
How will I do this one?...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Can I have the gun?
Go?
Please stay.
You did? That's funny. So did we.
Yes?
I don't understand 'friend.'
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
Yes.
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
You liked my singing?
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
Hurry up.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
But...
I understand.  Thank you.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
Fly.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Damn right.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
But this is a bad one.
Is he dead?
What do you mean?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Coming with you.
Get it.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
So the guy's not a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Jesus, Mace!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
You really want that on your head?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
What does the Manager say?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
A grill pattern.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Look...
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
He had an orange hat on.
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Do you think he singled you out?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
How long ago?
Collected shoes too?
I didn't use Low's name.
We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
A very sexy case.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
I just need to go a little slow.
What's going on?
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
You okay?
I'm going to Amarillo.
Sit back.
The little piggie speaks.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Koessler?
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Shit.
Nikki.
Like the quiche?
Not lately.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
What do you do, Trent?
Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Hi, Mike?
I can call back...
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
An eight.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
Bud.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
Darwinism at its best.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
I just tested for one...
Well, let's hit that party.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh boy.
They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Make someone bleed.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
When?
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas!
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Always.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
She smiled, baby.
You think so?
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Baby, you did fine.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
She was hot.
It starts at eight...
Minnie Pearl.
She didn't notice.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No, baby!
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
What was cold about it?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...Shut up, Sue...
Yes. 
And what is that Bonasera?
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
Yeah.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
The gun will be there.
We gotta move...
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Now you've had your drink.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Good.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Where are you going?
Give them some money and send them home.
Okay.  One minute.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Mike, why am I out?
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Al Capone!
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
My brother, Tom Hagen.
Michael...
How is your father?
He'll be OK.
I love you.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
When will I see you again?
Goodbye.
Don't you want dinner first?
Theresa.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Be patient.
He talked to you?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You're unlucky.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
What?
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Bird!
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
Copy out from here...
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
I didn't mean with you in it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
So tell me.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Dickie?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Have you done something to your hair?
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I'm sure we've met.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I absolutely agree with Marge.
What about Cortina?
I'll go and see what's the matter.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
Right.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
You know what -- I am.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
I'm fine.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Postmortem?
I really don't want to see anybody.
What about Ripley?
November, I thought.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
A few days ago.
No!
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
I have!
Huh?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Really?
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
Oh. Who was that again?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Keep it.
Well, I hope he wins.
You forgot "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Just follow me.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
You carry a piece? You need one?
Nah.  I suppose not.
Well... I guess so.
Easy.
Iris.
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Besides, I've got to stay here.
What's so important?
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I can't sleep nights.
There's porno theatres for that.
No, I want long shifts.
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
You would, huh?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
I know.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Well yes I suppose ...
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
What's that?  Mason?
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
I am, too.
... including me.  Right?  
You mean,  me?
I had it, a minute ago...
I do?
Whoa.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh...
Have you got a cigarette?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Exactly.  And he got good.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Well, then, as what did you go?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
The Bijou?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
When did I leave?
Mother.  She's beautiful.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
... what?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
What.
She's very pretty.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
So, it is a blacklist.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Exactly.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
I can play the piano?
No.
Oh.
Thanks.
The customers?  I don't know...
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Got any money?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Thank you.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
How'd you happen to come here?
Different?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I did.
Just listen to them!
Just a little one.
I know.
Morning.
Where does he live?
And the white house?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Birds are not bad!
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
How long have you known her?
Yes, Mother.
Yes?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
Where will we go?
Get a rope!
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
They won't be.
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Then he saw.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
And if you don't?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
We know what it is, Al.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
These birds were...
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
I understand completely, sir.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Doesn't what make me...?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Hey, wait a minute!
How?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
What made it...
How do you know Annie?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
What did it say?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Oh. That. Rome.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Cheers.
I do different things on different days.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Yes.
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Really? Tell me about it.
Hear!
What do you mean?
I'm frightened, Mitch.
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
...insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet. If it weren't for birds...
Can we go on living here otherwise?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Not if they're starting a war.
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
But can't you give me any idea?
Of course I will.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
I'm cold as ice.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
MacFarlane
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
But you did promise.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
I can't believe that.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
No.
You've no thought of going there?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
Why, yes.
A doctor?
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
You will not have it?
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
I've had some experience.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The heart pumps it.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I've drunk enough tonight.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Any attacks of pain since?
Three years.
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
Tell her... we'll get him.
The strip joint?
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
You're him. Corvis.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
I don't want to see!
Yeah, we do.
I know.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
What did I say?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Why not, Bobby?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I don't believe it.
About 250 million of your miles.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Is that what you're thinking about?
I feel different right now.
May I see you for a minute?
Yes--?
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Zero.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
Honda 250, huh?
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Hey, take it easy.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Hit the lights again.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Sam, don't --
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
I thought we were goin' into town.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
I thought we were poor.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Soon.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Take laddie.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Piss off.
Watch Clark.
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
You lying bastard...
Look, I'm just guessing...
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
You buy any of this, Blair?
Garry's missing!
Then kill me.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Maybe we shouldn't.
Come on, Copper.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Extinguishers.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Everything that's been missing.
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
The generator!
MacReady...?
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
What else can they do?
The Hall of Books.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Do you know which way?
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
It can't all be like this...
Because...
I just love mechanical things.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Dance with me...
I mean... well... affection.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
It's only a machine.
Tonight's the night?
Where's the challenge in that?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
Perseverance.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Yes...
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes!
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What are you?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
I see.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
No...
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
We choose to believe it.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
I'm fine.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
It's not my job to believe you.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
Temporarily.
You sure you know where to find one?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
How...how are you here?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
That's too bad.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Yeah.
[Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
I know.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
I don't know.
No, he didn't.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Then, where are you going?
I'm doing fine.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Because I don't have time.
And how do you know that?
Yeah.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
I wasn't talking about anything.
[Beat] How do you know?
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
[Beat] Thanks.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
Uh-huh.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Tell us about him.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
Stop.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
What?
Tell me.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Who is it?
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Isn't this fun?
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
I won't wait up.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Lemme see the map.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Try to.
They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
Yeah.
I want you to call Darryl.
I can see that.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Where?!
Go?
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
His mother?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Huh.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
'That right?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Big time.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
The sawbones?
Pat Healy.
How'd you know that?
I beg your pardon?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
Deco.
How about -- ?
Huh... that's strange.
Any idea where I might start looking?
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Surprised?
What?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Four.
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What?
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
That must make it tough.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
I don't watch the new ones.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Healy.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Really? I never got a message.
Thanks.
On your ear, you've got something.
I agree there should be more.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
All right, let's go.
Eh.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
What if I can't?
Then you'll call, right?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
What does the letter say?
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Yes it is.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
Still heading for Cuba.
All right. Then I guess it's time.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
I don't care. Cancel it.
No way.
I know, I know...
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
I see.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
A murder. On the reservation.
Again. Figures, man.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
What journey?
Tell him, Ray.
Good. Thank you.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
No way, Cooch.
Let's go.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He said he doesn't know.
Because he was talking to me.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Mister Tully.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Why not?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
You're an animal.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
What?
That's what I want.
I sit. I think. I play games.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
What truth?
True.
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Tomcats?
Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
Okay, okay.
BREAKING LEFT!
Roger, I've got it.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
The list is long, but distinguished.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
That's because you don't have any women.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
Figured out what?
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
I know. I was there.
No bother.
I'm nothing like him.
He was by the book, all the way.
You think I shouldn't fly.
What was that?  An accident?
You're getting off to an early start.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Who is it this time--my mother?
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
You better get down here.
It's not my fault.  We hit a memory cap.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
At Rekall.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
You're Kuato, right?
They sell fake memories.
I did?
I'm late.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
It was implanted by the Agency.
Implanted.
It's time you found out.
I'm here at Rekall.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Doug, don't!
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
I guess he didn't.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
I'm not falling for it.
You two-faced-bastard.
It's just up ahead.
...Who are you?
What was I doing on Mars?!  Damn!
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
No.  We go straight.
You're really leaving, huh?
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
That's the plan.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
What?
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
You okay?
I have to talk to your brother.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
What about entrapment?
Not at all --
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
But what?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
-- Roger -- ?
I followed her from the courthouse.
I've seen this picture before.
Neither.
You're doing a murder case?
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
That's right.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
For control of the prison drug trade?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
Tell me some other things about her.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
The stuff we got last night.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Thanks.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
That's what I heard.
Cole said she was 17.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
I think that's a good idea.
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Of course...
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
What can I tell you?
How did the car get back here?
Maybe.
No... No...
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Send me a kiss.
What? She asked about my father?
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
When am I going to see you?
Everything, but everything.
See what?
Mom... what are you wearing?
Yes.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
That's right.
I'm kind of busy, Norma.
You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Yes. It would be.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
Neurology?
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
It was good of you to meet...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Yes... I... yes.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
It's a common medical term.
And you wrote that...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
Yes? Galvin, right?
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Mrs. Simmonds.
Yes.
Yes.
A single hour.
Mr. Concannon...?
What Hotel are you staying at?
Laura.
Is this a bad time.
I've got to work.
Yes.
You, you don't under...
No.
I can't guarantee that...
Yes. Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
...I'm sure you do...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
I'm going to help her.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
No.
I'm going to get laid.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
I think we tried that. The case is over.
...one of the other nurses?
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
What?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Yes, the roving nurse...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
How'd you guess?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
Don't let's lose each other.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
It might give us something.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
Chase. Hi...
I'll be there in three hours.
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
The mean old man with the claws.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Your bed?
Home, that's right.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Here.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's okay?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Guilty.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes sir.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Yeah.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
I just can't believe it.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Figured what out?
What's the difference?
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Yes.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Do what?
But you invited is aboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
No.
No.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
It has nothing to do with him.
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
She's Cuban.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
You know what he is talking about here?
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
I'm sorry...
I can't.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
No.  I didn't.
Then what are you trying to say then?
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Get out.
Fuck me.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
She really say she was pregnant?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
You heard from Reggie?
No, of course.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
What's that, peanut?
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
What's that?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You got me, peanut.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
Yeah, I'm here.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
The only one.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Like hell.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Got any plans?
What if I told you not to?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Santos...
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Yes.
No... But...
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
You heard right.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Thanks...
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
So I hear.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
She's a transvestite.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Shut up and drink.
Because... because...
Maybe... I don't know.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
So whose car is it?
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
In a sense.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
No. There's no one here.
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
Could you hold on a minute, honey?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No! What gave you that idea?
Sounds like a good one.
A little.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Yea, James.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Yes.
The bus station.
Your aunt?
Jesus, James. Wow.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
I'm not going, with them.
Do?
That good, huh?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
You heard? How?
I'm kidding. Hello?
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
And what do you think you might have said?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
And you're old.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
I'm in love with your wife.
I was thinking of you.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
That's weird.
No, I'm going ho --
Just a few then. The big ones.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Foreman now.
No shit.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
Early July.
C'mon, Walter.
Isn't it?
Sure.
Is that right?
If you could, you would have brought one today.
I fell asleep.
Fairy tales?
I was asleep.
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
Apartment's okay.
Do you have many friends?
Robin?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Does he?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Can't I stay a little longer?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
That's right.
No way.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
That's right.
Then think about it.
I wish you'd give it a try.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
I don't need someone else.
Then why are you talking about this?
I'm not that crazy.
Why do you think you're here?
I'm afraid not.
How do you define it?
They usually tell me.
How do they know?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Go home, Walter.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
I see my sister.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
A nap?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I'm only asking questions.
I was six years old!
I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
What do you think?
What about them?
Not tonight.
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
Sounds like a special guy.
Why young girls, Walter?
They seduce you?
Bullshit.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Prove it.
Where're you?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Your rig?
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Cute, Virgil.
What about O-2?
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
God, I hate that bitch.
Do we just leave him there?
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
You watch yourself.
Missed what?
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
Copy that.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
What's the timer set for?
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
What a question... Because I want to be with you, naturally. I hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... Isn't this water wonderful!
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And why haven't they left each other?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
What! Get married?
That's why I asked you...
Aren't you going to change?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
But why all nudes?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
What do you think?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
You men are all so dreadful!
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Well...probably at the last stop, which is Noto.
Thank you.
I'll go and get my valise.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Why?
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
Why?
Who tells you these things?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
But she watches... she listens.
I'm not hungry.
Yes, of God.
No.
It's not my time of month.
Oh, there are so many.
You've been alone together?
At least once a week.
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
Something I ate.
I got sicker.
Then let's talk about something else...
Are you married?
Not at the moment, no.
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Who?
I don't know.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?
I was a mistake.
Everything... I don't have children.
She can.
Yes.
Why?
Oh, yes.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
No I'm not.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
I can't tell you that.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Who?
What do you feel?
Of what?
Go away, I don't want you here.
So I could go to him.
Him.
So she sent you?
Yes.
Yes.
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
She took the baby in her arms?
Why?
If I find anything I'll call you.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
... Thank you.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Could there have been anyone else?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
That possibility never occurred to you?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Visitors to the convent.
Sister Paul?
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
About what?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Bullshit yourself!
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Saint Peter?
Yes I do.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
My God, you're as crazy as...
How  ?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Why would I lie?
Hasn't she had enough?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
The baby?
The scandal...
Before or after you killed the child?
Then she's a liar.
The usual ten per cent?
The cards... you're bank.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Just you?
What they like?
Read 'em!
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Ta.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
I'll look in here again.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Are you pulling my leg?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Yes.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
You can learn from books.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
What?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Yeah ... so what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Hello.
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Temper! Temper!
Someone put it on me.
Nerves.
Clever.  George.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Cattle ranch!
Hell, we're equipped --
Do you remember the pyramid?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
Looks like a derelict.
No, you'll follow me.
You want to try?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Right.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
How many?
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Yes, thank heaven.
Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Any microorganisms?
Found what?
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
So the next step should be --
Can we get to him?
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Kablooey.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Wait a minute.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Okay, give me the numbers.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Keep trying!
Nooooo!
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
What?
I'll come with you.
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
What's the problem?
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Compensate!
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Want some?
Check out the tent.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
No!
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
Just like that.
Do you know, Eve - sometimes I think you keep things from me.
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Stars.
We're?
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
But the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to New York - didn't it?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
That's how you met me. In passing.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Amen.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
This is Eve Harrington.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Where's my coat?
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
I get a party, don't I?
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
I thought you were going to be late-
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
So she seems.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Who?
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
Don't be condescending.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
I just wondered.
Why what?
It's only one picture deal.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
What have I got to do with it?
Find out.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
See you home...
Oh-oh.
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
Hmm?
Why not?
She works hard.
Night an' day.
Probably not.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
He can help you.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Of course it is.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
I wouldn't like.
Really, Eve? Why?
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Ain't it the truth?
The heave-ho.
I'm so happy you're happy.
I detest cheap sentiment.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
It's just possible she didn't...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Nothing...
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
I'm sure.
That's beside the point.
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights!  I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
I didn't hear you.
I said I'm a dying man!
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
I was sure trying.
Hmm.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
About the past year.
--I'm trying--
--you do?--with access to records?
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Facts or theory?
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
Who'd you vote for?
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--Colson.
--has he got an ax?--
How high up, which Republicans?
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
And?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
There's always a later plane.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
FBI too?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Who were they?
What do you want to know?
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
I don't know titles.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
--I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
Go on.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Good God!
--I'm Woodward.
No.
You can't believe that.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
Who's Colson, Harry?
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--can we use their names?--
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
Sure.
Like what?
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Yes ma'am, I am.
Yep.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Why is this?
Forget it.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
You talked to Stifler?
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Yeah right.
...I've never tried it.
Sure.
What?
No you haven't.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
You can crash at Stifler's?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Yes.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Shame on you!
Move with the music.
Tonight?
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
That's my trick!
You want to do it?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Okay.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Once, in church, dude.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
I'm such a loser.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Dude, he does not.
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
Uh huh.
No way.
Also like sex with my wife.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
Uncle Terrence.
I told him it wasn't ready...
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Not that I know.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
He says -
I was showing Sonya something . . .
When you're older . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Then come find me.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Who's Sophie?
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
Come out! I can do alterations.
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Why?
Now just get off the train.
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
Is it? Is this what you want?
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Shut up!
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
Ah! Let us begin!
Watch me.
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Alvy.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
The alarm clock.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Me? Oh, downtown!
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Okay.
Oh, you do?
Your grammy!
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Yeah?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
As Balzac said...
Good? I was-
Here, you want some?
What? What?
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Oh, yeah.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Were you always funny?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Yeah?
G-go on, I'm interested.
Yeah.
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Will it change my life?
Life. I said, "life."
I'm following you and David, if you-
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
W-w-whatta you mean?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
I don't know.
What... huh?
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Nothing at all?
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
Can I confess something?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Why are you so hostile?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Commentary.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's a narrow view.
Right before his un-American thing.
Yeah, I love it there.
You're crazy!
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
But she's colored.
SO?
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
No.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
And here, you just-
Uh, how did this personality come about?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Had a little help?
It has your ring.
I'm not that good.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
I'm in mourning.
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
Borrow whatever you like.
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Yeah.
Damn straight.
Anymore.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Can I open it?
Please?
Just did.  Jealous?
Nice to meet you.
They're paying him scale.
There's still time to undo this.
Did you invite them?
Scout's honor.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Not.
I mean, you're really back.
What?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
Really?
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
It's not like this all the time.
And how hard it hit?
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
You don't have to.
Has she called?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh.  Well.  Good.
It's a novel.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
Yes I did.
Joking.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
You're an interior decorator, right?
We're way past inappropriate.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
He always has two or three going...
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
God willing.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I...
Not at all.
The charades.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Like your business managers?
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
No.  Not something new.
I guess.
Oh Soph...
Not nice.  Not kind.
No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
Wait!  When can I see you again?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Wait, I hear something!
Let's dig in!
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't get all sappy about it!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
That's correct, sir!
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
I'm glad you asked me that question!
I'll be back.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Fine.  Wait.
Good night.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
So I see.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
This is a bad day for me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
And where are you now?
No -- it's my stomach.
Your stomach?
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
Open it.
Give what up?
Cut.
Too slow?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Gin.
I just want some fresh air.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
Mind if I come in?
Seven --  -- queen.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Last night?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
I'm not through with you yet.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Mine?
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
I see.
Very clever.
No I didn't.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Who else?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Me?
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
Just as long as she's okay.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Yeah, wasn't I?
Sure, Doc.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
You got a girl-friend?
The party's over.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
Are you sure that's what you want?
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Yeah, we better.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
What !
Esprit de corps --
Get out --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
What is this?
Yeah. Way north.
Sort of.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
We do.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
How?
I don't know.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
Who's he?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Who knows what's up there?
We're Americans.
Looks pretty shallow.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
Anyone got a cigarette.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
Charlie?
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Boss left.
You want'a surf, soldier?
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Hairy ?
I met him.
Who?
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
I love it.
How's the pain?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
I'm gonna get you out of here.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
You think?
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
You're Australian?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
Beverly Hills --
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
134  CONTINUED:  
157  CONTINUED:
Back against the bars.  Now.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Was there any trouble?
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
That's my line.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
My home is here.  With you.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
That makes the flight more interesting.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
You know Meyerling?
Yeah?
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Where's the kid?
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Not bad.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Yes.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Okay.
Spence.
Yes.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Okay.
My son.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Fries.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll take a bus.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Stop staring. Do a vase.
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
He's a pain in the ass.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
What?
No, I didn't.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Get out.
Come on, sweetheart...
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
Did you like it that much?
What's it mean?
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
I know you're going to jump.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Oh, yeah.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
What?
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Take us there.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
He stole another contract.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
Yeah?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Ten million --
Now you understand why I'm here.
You didn't know anything about me.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
He wants to kill you?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Where you wanted to be?
How old were you?
Because you are a women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
About?
I don't know.
Why not?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Yes.
No.
Here?
Cheap as shit.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Okay.  Then what?
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
What did he say?
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
So?
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
Is this becoming complicated?
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Honesty.
Sure.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
You mean quit?
I have all day.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
He was an electrician?
That makes you an expert I guess.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
I thought that was part of the charm!
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Who put a bee up your butt?
He's lying! I am.
Tell me some bad news?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Good, what's his number?
No!
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Here's the details.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
No way Doug, I can't.
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
But I love you!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
How?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
Sure!
How did he look?
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Not all of them!
Yeah.
Just yesterday.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Go to hell!
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Some Americans?
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
It could help with a new car --
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I didn't know either.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
I need to whizz.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Demented.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Ambitious.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
I'm really glad you think so.
Yes. And?
You.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
That's what I mean.
I'm not going back to school.
Better. I was really angry.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Dad --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
No.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Praying.
In there.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
A similar triangle?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
I beg your pardon?
This is 1952....?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
Oh yeah.
I don't think I like the idea of you staying out all night with a girl!
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
What drill?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Home, school, here... 
Yeah,  Right.
So what? We'd be rich!
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
A car.
What? 
What's going on?
Okay.
I'll catch up with you.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
Does he bite?
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Tom...
Thanks.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Yeah? Why not?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What for?
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Something mi trabajo.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can look and see.
You said that once already... Too late now.
I'm serious.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Stay as long as you like.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Not me. No way.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Where's the professor?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
No, I don't.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
It's too dangerous.
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Bet I do.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Hello.
Before what?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Chet! From downstairs!
I...
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Well not much.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Charlie. How are you.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
Seen a doctor?
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Ready... wrestle!
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Are you sure –
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
You gotta believe me –
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this–
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
And then... well...
Mr. Lipnik.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US –
The others are being sent.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
All night?
Yeah.
She was there, wasn't she?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
What else is new?
I thought you quit.
What?
Yes, you do.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Because you didn't love him --
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
No.
You can make a mistake.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
I don't have a choice.
I'll convince you.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
Yes I am.
What was the weapon?
That's him.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
I don't believe it.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
We bring her in for questioning.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
No. Should I have?
When's your show?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
I think it's in New Jersey.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
No.
Aren't they?
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Decipher?
Yes, but as a black painter –
Not what?
Not black.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Who's John Henry?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
I'm your family.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
A present I picked up for you.
Pretty much the same.
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
Thanks
No, I'd like the scarf.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
You're a fast mover.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
My point exactly.
I'll make you another one.
Forget it.
I didn't know.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I will relay the message.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
"Shreck's."  You --
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I'm listed.
I'm tempted.
Yes and no...
Had one.  Didn't work.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
No hard feelings?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Was.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Dad!  Save yourself!
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Thanks.
It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
Alfred's happy here.
I'm afraid to ask.
Be ready for anything.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She wants to kill you.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I find that unlikely.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
I remember the bat, though. His scream. Those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  In time I came to believe that if I became a monster, that if I was feared, I wouldn't be scared anymore. I was wrong.  They think I became Batman to fight crime. I became Batman to fight the fear. And instead I became the fear.
What do maniacs always want?
Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Exactly!
Slanta.
Rinka.
Wacko? That a technical term?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
What do you know about obsession?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
What?
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, Bruce? If it weren't for Batman my parents wouldn't be dead. You don't get it, do you? This is all your fault.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
What the hell is going on here?
The small one.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
... Murderer...
WHICH CAR?
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I'll take you with me.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
WHAT?
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Great. How??
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Sort of half.....
No, I'm fine.
Certainly is.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And a car.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
I am sorry you feel that way.
Are you?
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Me first!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Uh... We can't leave Washington 'till we find that chick.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Okay. I'll go right after you.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Butt-snatch...
Uh... butt-snatch...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Thrr...
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
I see it. I don't get it.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
How's your arm?
That's how long you were gone.
What's she doing here?
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
Now, let's get rolling!
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
About what?
No, wait!
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
Can you help <u>me</u>?

What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Stepmother.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
It wasn't a joke.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
Oh, fine.
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Yes, I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Certainly, glad to be of help.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
My name is Chance.
I am a very good gardener.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
Thank you, Eve.
Thank you.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Do you like it?
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Ben is very ill.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
So you know Krylov!
Yes, it is very good!
Yes. I like that name very much.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
What sort of bed is it?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Of course. I would like to look.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Since you were a child?
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I have no claim, Thomas.
... Oh, really...
I said - try again.
No headaches?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
That's good... That's good.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
No, sir.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Okay.
Malkovich!
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Yeah, okay.
Tell your friends.
May 11th.
Hmmm.
The iguana.
What's that?
Fuck Maxine.
You bastard.
What's that?
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
People make mistakes.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
Simulates?
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Yex?
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
My God.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Ha ha ha!
Two hundred dollars, please.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Think, Jew florist?
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Oh, be still my heart.
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Why not? I need to get in there!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Great then.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Whatever.
Well what?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
Yes sir
I will.
Oh.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
No..No that won't do...
Could be that fall you took.
But mama..
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
That's so.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What? What? You talking back to me?
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Well Dude, we just don't know.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
We have the urn.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
What--
So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
What's that, Walter?
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And was there anything of value in the car?
...Also, my rug was stolen.
And the, uh, the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Yeah, but what about--
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Well...yeah--
Well yeah...I know that.
Uh-huh.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Walter, he peed on my rug--
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
What if it's during a game?
I told him if it was during league play--
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Easy, Dude.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Huh?
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh.
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
It is a fucking emergency.
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Then what's...
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
You're a fuck, Walter!
Friends like these, huh Gary.
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Employed?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well. . . yeah.
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!
Impressive.
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a little death."
For what?
Did you think I wouldn't?
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Just out connecting a few dots.
Then who does he work for?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Thought you were dead.
I don't know about this, man --
He was here.  Watching us.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Cancer.
How long have we been driving?
No --
Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
No problem.
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Go on, I'll be fine!
With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia.
Join the club.
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
Who?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
What?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
I can't let you in.
Both. Now.
No.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
Ask me what I don't have.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Yeah?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
Gimme it!
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
--I dunno, I just woke up--
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
Enough to keep sane.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Elly Kedward?
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Not this one.
--the Sheriff's Office--
Meurice--
You don't look too good. You sleep last night?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Yeah...
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
Ray--
We don't seem to be communicating--
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
...Hell.
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
...What?
Nah, I trust ya.
What's the point?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
What?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Yes?
The criminals are winning.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Who knows you have these?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
I wanted to see you.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
Yes.
No. please. I won't.
No. What is happening?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Do you love me?
Just get outta my bed.
No. it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
It's okay. it's okay.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Let's go.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Yes.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Okay. okay.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
What is it?
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Good deal Dad.
What?
Alright.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
On the plane.
Motherfucker works fast.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
You'll see for yourself.
We'll take it.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Excuse me?
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
The coca is my responsibility!
No.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
You failed because you had the wrong dream.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Oh my G-d.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
George, are we gonna do this or not?
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
Try the back bedroom.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Sure.
Yeah, well...
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I know.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Why are you smiling?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Kristina's fine.
What's happening to us?
You can call me Dad if you want.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Swear on my life.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
They're over at the booth.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
The strike is a success; but ...
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
I want you to hit all the dealers in town.  Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.  Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in Roseburg.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
What about the will?
But there's more?
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Like cats and dogs.
What was the nature of the argument?
Could you be more specific?
Sit down, Frank.
You can't show intent.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I didn't hear it.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
No.
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
She was here?
You called him?
Oriental medicine.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
I suppose.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
No.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
Why'd you come here?
Yes.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
No pain, no gain?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
I went out on the boat.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- you're not.
I love you too, Dad.
Really?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Please -- not now.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Why are there two deeds here?
Lawyer here?
He's not coming.
What problem?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
Well, I'd like to read them.
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Then why do you?
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
You're right -- that is sick.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
She used to be so friendly.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Not at all.
And how long are you here for?
Oh. How old?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Do you miss it?
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
But no one in particular.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Oh, sure. Great.
Okay. See you later.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
TO HELL WITH YOU!
But now that you have it -
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
What's she like?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Bones.
Just try it.
How did you get in here?
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
And the hell everybody else, right?
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
All the more reason I should be here.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
The dead get out?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't!
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
I didn't sell it.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
You haven't?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Two point one seventy-six.
What's that, Johnnie?
Where is it?
You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
But you know he did it.
All right, Caesar.
The hell I can't!
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Caesar ...
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
You betrayed me!
You murdered Gino!
Shut up!
They were in a car accident.
What?  How about a drink?
Another time.
Okay, sure, Mick.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
You did the right thing.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Thanks.
Yeah, come on in.
Why?
Don't apologize, please.  I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
I'm already in your bed.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
Mickey?
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Thank you.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Hey.
I thought you were never going to do that.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
This doesn't go upstairs.
What do you want to do?
We don't know what we're into!
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Jason Bourne is dead.
You have your passport?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
-- sir? --
Did you?
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
What does that mean?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Jason...
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
...omigod, no...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
What is that?
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
No.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
...Yer nostril?
...sabotage!
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
In fact, killing people -
Beginner's luck.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Ah ...
What is it?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
A terrorist?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Is it stamped?
Information Adjustments.
No.
Why?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Get away!
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Yes.  Come out, I know you're in there
Leave me alone!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
No you're not!
Your face ... are you hurt?
No. No. I'm fine. I was worried sick about you ... I thought ...
The refund for Tuttle!
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Don't mention it. See you later.
Yes.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Um ...
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
But I could be anybody.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
Es impossible.
Mary, we really have to go.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
No!
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Okay.
Fifteen minutes.
I need to sit down a minute.
God help us, he's hungry too.
That's too many.
What do you think?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
No.
He was tough. You did all you could.
I'm sorry.
Do it!
Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
What's wrong with it?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
A half hour in the lobby.
Why do you say that?
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
Did you shoot their boots?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I have to be somewhere.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
How?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Your hair's a little funny.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
The cost-efficient reporter.
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
I'll never tell.
Yes.
No, I don't think so.
That's okay.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Anchor?
Tell me I'm on the way in.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
How are you at back rubs?
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's not it.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
Where are you?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Uh-huh.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
What?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Through the closet.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
I just might.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Are you nervous, Walter?
You're breaking my concentration!
Anything new?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Honest?
Of course...it's wonderful.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Of course I do!
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
What is it, your laundry?
Got carried away, huh?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
What, Mr. De Santis?
It was.
Well, w-what did you do?
No...look I'm busy...
Uh, hi.
Huh?!!!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Uh, I don't know.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Here here!
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Coach knows what abs are?
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Maybe.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
What?
I think you've forgotten something.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
No, you're not.
I know.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
Where?
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I forgot.
Get out of my facial.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
She --
All right.
It's true.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Uh... gym.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Not if you're careful.
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
All right.
And where are they now?
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Thank you very much.
You're having a fling with him?
Nicole...
Later for it.
Hi.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Swear to God.
Okay.
Like you've got a grip.
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
You can learn to like it.
God, I never thought of that.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
How 'bout a back rub?
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I think you're real cute.
it's okay..
You don't have to...
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I won't be needing these anymore.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You got me all confused.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
He won't make love to me anymore.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
You okay?
He looks great, just great!
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
If you believe in Voodoo.
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
You're a cocksucker!
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Well, I held it like an egg.
Gimme that.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Go for it.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
See ya at the yard, Meat.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Can I give you my testimony?
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Ain't here.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
What are you talking about?
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
He's lying.
You were wandering around.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
You got it.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Speeding?
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Help, Daddy!
Wh-wh -
I don't know.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
No, of course not.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
No.
Then he called me a faggot.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Okay.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Just say so.
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
All right.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Hey, she came to talk...
...to me.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
And what'd she want?
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah, she's here.
I'll be right there.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Okay. You come by the house?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
No. Just stop everything.
Why not make them happy?
Right away. Okay?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Yeah, I know all that.
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
No.
You didn't have to beat him up!
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
And...
...the rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
Get out of here!
With Jennifer.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Who were you with?
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
I should have -
You fuckin' whore!
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I am not!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
But it was just mine.
They had all the pieces they needed.
...and hypocrisy.
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Eight children! 
Okay, I'll -
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
This is not the way to treat people.
Can't do it with both hands?
I didn't give 'em the m-
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Well, I've been busy. 
You can't talk to me like...
Go get a bag, man.
Okay.
It's instinctive, you know.
Is that the last one?
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
He's gone?
He's not here?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Hm.
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
And how are things going down there?
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Exactly.  He hates me.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
But I saw something...
I told you I was hot tonight.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Yes.
Yes.
Come on! 
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
No, I'm gonna drive.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
She asleep?
Yeah?
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
How you doin'?
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Well. I stand corrected.
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I actually got some memory back last night.
Oh now this one is mine...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Not too cool...
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
Trust me, you won't have to.
The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Can you make him stop!
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
And what're you whispering for?
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Where'd they take you to?
What makes you say that?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
The City National on San Vincente.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Why tell me this?
Did you hear that click?
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Are you okay?
Can you walk?
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Do you have to point that?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
What's Nels' number?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
There are no guarantees in this life.
I wish it had never been invented.
I still don't see you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
I won't let 'em.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I thought you'd know me by now.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Doesn't everybody?
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
What do you think his name is?
Good thing in a man.
Stop it, Dil --
It's Dave.
She's not that either.
Don't know. Who is she?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
Jesus.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Must be in love to manage that.
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
That's good...
You say that like a gentleman.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Tell him it hurt --
Must be.
I said stop it.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Absolutely.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
What's her?
I promise.
What?
Died...
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
Fergus.
Tell me what she wore.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
You will, Dil
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Carnations.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Someone's got to do it.
Leave me alone, Jude.
So you did fuck up.
No, what is the thing?
Was I?
Why would you do that?
Thanks.
Would make me feel better about it.
I understand.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
I seen your fucking face.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Could you?
Why not?
My pleasure, Jody
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Take her picture. C'mere.
I told you not to talk that way --
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
You won't run.
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
And you know what?
It was fun while it lasted.
No, we are.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
What?
What about it?
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
You lied to me so many times --
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
We? You mean you're --?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
No.
Barely, yes.
May I have a cigarette, please?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Very good.
Next, please.
Around one.
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Would you like to see my passport?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Come here.
I dare you.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
And the last one?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Is that all? Can I go now?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
That's all.
Yes?
Because I don't love him.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
You said that two weeks ago.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No. I'll handle this.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
You know about that too?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
Why?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
He says he loves me.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
NO?!
I won't.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Twenty eight years ago.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
I need to ask you something.
Attacked how?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
Kenny's aunt?
What?
Did you want one?
They're tasty.
No, you keep one.
You can't bring it.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
That wasn't me ...
Okay, okay.

He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
A ruler?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Oh yes.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
That's too bad.
Too bad?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Yes... I think I can manage...
Oh, my, yes.
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Ain't worth thinking about.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Oh they don't?
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
Off the alley.
I'll throw that in too.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
But what?
How are you, Lou?
Summer colds are the worst.
No.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Yeah?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
What for?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Gittes, stay outta this.
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
She's cheating on him.
Where you were when your husband died.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
Over the water department, or over you?
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
And Hollis knew about it?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Your eye.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
What about?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
What does it look like?
...That's not what I meant.
Where's the girl?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
Back to Mexico.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
When did you come in?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Who?
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
I said, the northwest valley.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
Yes...
Do you know me?
Have we ever met?
Si.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
That's a long fall.
So how are you, Morty?
Who?
But...
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
He's not in, Mr.?
May I ask what this is regarding?
Yes. No.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
Well, you never know, do you?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Come in, Alfredo.
No, nobody came. 
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 
Somebody stole it.
Thais.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Two cents.
Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
You don't really think so?
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Well, well - isn't that nice?
Certainly not.
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Are they standing for me?
I don't my plans myself.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
We haven't heard from him.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
I know...  But you do look so silly.
I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
I didn't say.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Half past eleven.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
I'll get you some coffee.
Why, Brad?
Brad, you are drunk.
Why is she leaving me?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Was he in love?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Yes and no.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
What did you get?
What the hell is that?
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Sure. Go ahead.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Exactly.
You're kidding.
I can't believe you're here.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
How do you know that?
So you're really getting married?
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
You don't have anything to do with it.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
So what are you saying?
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
It wasn't me.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
I can whip your ass.
What's your point?
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
So?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
You called Caitlin again?
You win.
Seven months.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
Empire.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Perfect dozen.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
The milkmaids?
Can you believe this?!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Can we not talk about this?
Exactly. They drank it all.
You hate people.
An embolism in a pool.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Bible truth.
No!
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
His dick was in his mouth?
Listen to you.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
Exactly.
Not yet. 
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're happy?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
I'll read the book.
Fuck you.
Could be.
I think four.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
What time did you get to work today?
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Just the paper.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I'm not dealing.
One seventy-nine.
Nothing personal.
Actually, that's his night job.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Jesus... go ahead.
Here. Now leave me alone.
I hate this fucking place.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
I touched a nerve.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
You've only had sex with three different people?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
He gets off on it.
Let it go...
HOW MANY?
A few?
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Goodbye, Dante.
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Randal...?
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
No way.
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
How long you gonna be here?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I have first dibs.
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Fuck you.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Bags?
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
The money!
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Look, I know--
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
Sure you can.
I'm sorry for all the trouble... Thank you.
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
We spent a night there one night...
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Oh, please.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Maybe lead to a flare up...
From one professional to another, of course.
Can't do it.
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Making things real rough for Hal.
You attacked me.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Helluva time for vanity!
Take the rope.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Half a day.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Do you always transport through the air?
There, what's that place?
Then go fetch.
You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No names, this is an open line!
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
How do you do, sir?
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Surprise?
Well, how are you then?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Do you mean Church of England?
Blue eyes, yes, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Fucking hell...
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Prison custody?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yeah... Pete the English.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
But not now?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Max, the cab driver!
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
So?
I never bought that.
Elvis?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Pick me up in five minutes.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
I've been calling and calling.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
Hang on.  Carefully...
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
You prefer nights?
Why not?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
Max.
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
What?
Who was he?
How?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I never learned jazz.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
Oh, I'm captivated.
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
Why?
You had to kill Heller?!
Yeah, that.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
What'd they do?
...indifferent.
As in...? 
Vincent?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
No.
Arf... You gotta help me.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
Who?
Uh huh.
Who are you, Jerry?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
What's in Connecticut?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Is that what they told you?
Did you kill my father?
Love at first sight?
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Why not?
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
Without a love of my own.
Now she tells me.
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Whatever.
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
I don't believe you.
I was just thinking that.
I want to believe you, too.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
I'm willing to take that risk.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
You know why I'm here.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Ellie --
Are you threatening me?
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
It'll just take a moment.
What would you have me say, David?
Thank you?
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
This is how you see the sky?
It's a civilian facility.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
You want to classify prime numbers?
I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
But what do I say?
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
How long was I gone?
How do you mean?
And mind, yes.  What are you --
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
But --
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Yeah. Well.  Gettin' up here, Boss.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Here, Mom.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
Oh lean over here, lady. Lean this way.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
Don't hit me! Please, for God's sake, don't hit me.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
A Lucas Jackson.
Like an elephant.
Take it easy, Drag.
Thass right. Just play it...
No. No chains either.
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
But </u>alive</u>!
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
When was that?
I was?  How you spell that?
You come and visit.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You know where.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
For months... last October.
Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
They get fan letters...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
They all have one...
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
Okay.
Because it's your job, that's all.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
We could use a little help.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
Thank you.
It is?
You should have gone to the funeral.
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
Do you find him attractive?
One of your suitors?
One of my suitors.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
The case could be made.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
What's the matter?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
You've only known Jake a few months.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
You too, Mom.
Lie?
I've already checked it out 17 times.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
You've got one hell of a great body.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Are you OK?
The restaurant, too?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
Bingo.
Always the drugs.
Letty, please.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
I mean tonight.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
You just need to get more organized. L
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
No, no.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Michael.   Yes.
I think I've heard this speech before.
I dunno.
You're there now?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
What?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
I'm not here to negotiate.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
You have something for me?
Where are you from?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
No.   Chicks dig me.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
I will.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Just find them!
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
What is it you do, Sami?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Yeah, I can see that.
It's my idea.

Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
No.
I said a clean break.
Get in the car.
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
We don't know that for sure.
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
It's not your fault.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
I'll go and make up his room!
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
I owe you nothing.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You're probably right.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Come and get it if you can.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Kneel!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
Give it back!
If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
Don't ever come back.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
So what will you do now?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
You buying?
They make you fart.
Annie, I need a file.
You don't say.
Fucking A, my friend.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change...
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
I lost my key.
Mister Funboy.
In a better place.  I hope.
Right.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Miss her?
Fine with me.
I'm already alone.
Very well, it's your ass.
Who got himself what?
To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
Did you know Sebastian well?
I'll be fine.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
Got a boyfriend back home?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
You did?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You talking to me?
What'cha reading?
The Fountainhead.
Romantic? He rapes her.
At this hour? I don't think so.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
No thank you.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
Yes.
Of Human Bondage.
Yes it does.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
- none taken -
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
Okay.
It's Kathryn.
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Does your mother know?
Well... not exactly.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I want to go home.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I'm sorry.
No.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Outstanding.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
And if I win?
Shhh.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
What's your plan of attack?
I hate it too.
Any day now.
Cecile.
Who are you spying on?
What's your problem?
Nothing.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Oh yes.
Excuse me?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
Annette?
Well done.
Will you calm down?
War it is.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Black.
Absolutely.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
It's the least I can do.
I did?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You bastard!
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year — St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
What do you mean?
Did you ever make a wish?
At the old house with the voice.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
All right, mommy.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
I know that.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
I forgot I had it on.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Amy's been lying again.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It was on account of the birthday party.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I can not tell you.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
Don't cry, Amy.
But why?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
That's from her -- that woman.
Wait a minute. Listen.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
I've been working out.
At Victoria's Secret.
I mean where on your body?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Can't you get contacts?
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
No you don't, believe me.
No they're not.
There is a man's arm in my bed.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Tuesday. Are you okay?
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
Why not? There's been a murder.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Peter keeps asking me out.
I think I already have.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
No. I won't let you do that.
About Mark? Carlton?
Frida? You okay?
I do development for TV movies.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Knock what off?
You don't have to pee.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Yeah. Maybe.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
Interesting possibility.
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Okay.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, it was our first date.
No, take it.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Not really...
The other one?
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
He's seriously disturbed...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
I'm afraid so.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Wrong?  Look at this!
Shut-up.
Who?
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Where does it lead?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Why?
That's easy.  You...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Right.
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
A month.
I don't give a shit.
Up and around?  Soon?
Soon.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
You're kidding.
Three years.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He's only doing what you told him to.
The government
You could buy it on payments.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Well -- take care.
I'm not sure... I might have.
In the car?
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
This is wrong, Alan!
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Ah.
Yeah.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
Oh.
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Where are you going?
I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I know.
It's nice.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
What is it if it ain't a curse?
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
No wonder they're so....hungry.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
In the battle, sir.
I'm alright. Let's go.
What is the point?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Yes sir.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
what?!
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
It's Nuwanda.
It does?  What?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Todd Anderson.
I don't.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
Found what?
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
What the hell are you talking about?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
Who asked any?
I saved your life is what I did!
Who asked you to!
On the side!!
Yeah you did...
Yeah...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
I don't take orders at all.
Forget them...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What the hell does that mean?
Hey! Come out here!
I'm looking...
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did too!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
Who? Who is?
You don't!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
It won't open.
Where? Where is he?
But you must come in.
I came to see Merle.
Get anything?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
No?
Not so good.
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Here.
You Biederman?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I don't know! I don't know either!
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
And then you...
I know.
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
From Nam?
Yeah.
It's ahead, Vince.
Three bullets -- minimum.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Here! This is it!
No.
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Nick. Hey. How's things?
What's that noise?
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
What'cha got, Bennett?
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
Your mother.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Shucks, and I got all dressed up.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Give it to me.
I'll be alright.
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
He could be brought back.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
I got it.  I got it.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
I'm ready.
Technothugs.
I'm not fond of television comedies.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
You want to be a good detective?
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How ya feeling?
...Have you been drinking?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
We will --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
He lied to me again.
You know that you're in my house.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
All right, darling.
That's just too bad --
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
But what becomes of our souls?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
The seventh day of April --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
About what?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Dan'l Webster?
Yes.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Why not -- ?
Your butter money?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Jabez ...
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
You'll never change -- will you?
Jabez --
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Consarn the consarn --
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
Mary -- Jabez --
I guess we won't.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
What's that?
I won't forget.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
It's okay, it's okay.
So, you divorced of what?
But meant her moving here.
No, sir.
The police...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
So I've heard.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
You don't want to know.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
Bullshit.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
No.  I never smile any more.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
What about the kids?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Well, how'll I get home?
Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!
Oh, yeah, I will...
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
What trip?
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
You're crazy.
Why you going to Algeria?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Oh no!
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
I got Sal.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
... armed robbery ...
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
You tryin' to fuck me?
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
I took too long.
Mulvaney...
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
If you take anybody, please take me.
I'll be God damned if you will.
Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You like me?
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
Why not?
Yeah?
What about Howard?
No, that's all.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Get 'em in the vault!
What?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
We'd kill ourselves.
Does that still go?
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
They're beautiful ...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
Did Pop come down?

Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.

You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
That's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken.

But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Jade, I still love you.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
I thank you.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
I've done that before.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
I'm in here.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm going with you.
He's completely innocent.
...peanuts.
And move to Long Island...
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
ML, hold this for me.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Run it then.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
No.  What are you gonna do?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Later for you.
Eddie Murphy.
Keep dreaming.
Ya like him, huh?
I love you, my brother.
I love you, Black.
Sez who?
Sez me.
I love you.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Tell Pino.
Don't start on me today.
Sleeeeew sheek baw...
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
I know I am, Mom.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
So boys, how was your first day?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Oh, is this your special place?
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
You take that back!
Where did you learn that word?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Our own special bus.
How do you know it's for us?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
A blimp.
Hello, he only invented money!
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Well, I'm listening now.
I... found that rock.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
Do you know what this means?
That's the one I wanted.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Special Needs class.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Looks like the best man won.
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Piter.
Yes.
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Where are we do you think?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
No.  I never drink -- wine.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
I am always on time.
I didn't feel well...
Let me take you to the hospital.
I don't know how to make goulash.
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
Yeah, I did.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Oh, just like in the script!
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
I told you this was gonna happen.
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Yes?
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
Tor!
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
OUR picture?
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Why not??
"Your movie"?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Dynamite --
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Yeah...?
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
You're <u>sure</u>???
So how long have you known Eddie?
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Okay, I'm nuts.
Cool.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
When? Today?
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
She wouldn't tell me.
No, I mean...
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Who's in it?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Dynamite is dangerous.
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Oh yeah.
Shari, I really like you...
No. Who?
Really? 
Come on.
What did you do to your hair?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
What?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
We're excited.
What?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Screw off.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
No. What happened?
It's me, Ed.
Yeah...
We'd better go...
You brought the cameras here!
You know what your problem is?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
What?... Why?
Good?
Tu
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
What?
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
I think we've got a problem.
You know what they say about the early bird.
I know.
NO, that's fine
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
As far as I know, they--
Looks like Tim Kobza.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Looks like today's your lucky day
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
This weekend.
Exactly when?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Sure.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Right now?
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
And 290 "disregards," right?
These are private -- these are for us.
I mean at you.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
How'd she meet Patchett?
Do you enjoy it?
I don't know.
So you saved her.
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Homicide?  A detective?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
I got her address.
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
More.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
And?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
What about you?
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Yeah.  My whole life.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Of his penis, sir?
Why do men and women usually see each other?
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
Why?
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
I know how he feels.
Where is he?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Something good?
What's he doing here, Sid?
Yeah.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
What'd he give to you?
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Do it!
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
I don't know what that means.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
They're spooks.
What do you mean?
Where?
Fuckin-A.
Listen--
Reynolds.
Not particularly, no.
Law enforcement?
With what?
That's fine.
What size?
That's my point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
Your stuff?
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
I saw a man die.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
It's okay.
You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
Stacy--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Yes.
Just reporters.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Well...yeah.
You opened the thing?
It's not?
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Brill.
Thank you.
Eat your fish.
For the last four years.
I'm gonna fix it.
I've never met him?
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
Fuck you. You may have to--
Brill.
Bobby--
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
What are you talking--
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Hi, dad.
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Yes.
No, I--
To the cops?
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
What the hell does it mean?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We found the originals.
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
He had help.
He's clever. He had help.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Yes sir.
No sir.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
Excuse me.
Excuse me?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
Pardon?
Yes.  Absolutely.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Now.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
No.
It's a folk song.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Yes.  A different wife.
What?
Dance with me.
Oh dear.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Okay.
I don't know.
Or was it Toronto?
Bonjour.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
I can see my wife in that view.
Because I'm a nurse.
Your friend?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
Why?  Is he staying?
Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
I've met you before.
I try not to expect you.
It's what I've learned.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Only we have to go to work.
Pardon me?
Go away.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
This was your garden?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Through a window.
Why didn't I think of that?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
You can't.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
We are...for the tools.
Hmmm.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
It's your mistake.
A parting gift from the Empire.
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
But that's all behind us now.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
You can do it.
I'm not leaving without you.
But--
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
We're supposed to.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
She's calling the shots now.
You know where my loyalties lie.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
It's those files you asked for.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
If you hadn't used profanity --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
What medical records?
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Lemme see it, will you?
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
And that's what caused the contamination?
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Really?  It makes me sick.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
So what are you thinking?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Not in my world.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
No one's taking anything --
You're not gonna be there.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
How do you know that?
You come to the right place.
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
Right.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna clean it up.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
I can't leave my job, George.
More than you need me.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
Wow, that's soon --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Yes, My Lord.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
I feel The Force.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I'm going to see what it is.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Now you're making sense.
Beautiful.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
Yes, you do.
Outside, in the cave.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
Let Ôer go, Chewie.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
I didn't say anything?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
What are you talking about?
I thought I was in good shape.
That they are.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
I see a city in the clouds.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
I want that ship.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
We know that.
A display of primitive apparatus --
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Go on now. Do as I say.
I thought he was, but he came back.
What?
It's so good to see you again.
I got a new deal for you.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
A medical team will be standing by.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Delgado?
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Yeah, kinda.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Are you crazy?
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Well, I'll think it over.
...Perceval!
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
But your life and lands are far from here.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
In the great book.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
Love demands it.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Maybe... maybe...
People make you laugh?
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
Well what's wrong?
It's-
Why don't you let me?
Didn't who tell me?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
I can't believe it.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
A man to see you.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
Are you sure?
Where?
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Oh............
Where?
You like him.
But you like him.
Why does God let us get tired?
Withering Heights.
Intensely.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Merrin! Merrin!
Uoy era ohw.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Amen
The Lord be with you.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
It's possible. Possible however…
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Sick priest, is that it?
No I probably wouldn't.
Is that a threat?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
O'Lord hear my prey.
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
No.
Frank.
A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Jack...
I hate your kids, Frank.
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
Bosen black.  Flat.
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
It's more than that.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
You'll see.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack.
No?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Get out of here.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
You wanna get a drink?
Right.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Day.  Wednesday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Okay.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
Christ, can't you hear it?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
Time flies, huh?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
He was wearing a suit.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah.
He was just having fun.
I don't know. Some disease.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
You weren't there.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Fuck you.
Who's weak now, big brother?
Later.
Right.
I'll take the Mallory.
Good choice.
This'll kill 'em.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
All right.
Blanche.
Well, that's fine --
Don't take it personally.
Impersonally.
Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
What-?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Nine!
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Yeah.
Tell her.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Uh, well ...
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
How come?
Funny job.
Thanks.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Save it.  What's he look like?
I suppose.
His kid's sick.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
The Stratford.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Aren't the kids asleep?
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Hey, business is business.
How do you know?
Who's Nina?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Coffee?
We outgrew each other.
I've given it up.
Losing his teeth.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Wow.
None?
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
Drive.
Should be.  It's yours.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Is that what you think?
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Something good?
How come?
One last time.  It's important ...
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
What do you mean?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Don't count on it.
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
Get rid of them.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
I can see that, Alan.
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Okay, chief.
Uh-huh...
All in one tape?
What?
I was in the city.
Jack...don’t even start...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Do what?
Look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
It’s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I’m gonna buy it...
Really.
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Okay...
Now...I don’t...
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Way out...
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
It’s like a museum.
A perk for what?
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Jack.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Are you okay, Jack?
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
To Paris. Paris, France.
You’re not married, are you?
Don’t get on that plane!
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
I'd like that, too.
Merry Christmas...
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
<u>Should</u>?
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Go back to the drawing board.
Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Ben!  Ben!
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
They're not costumes.
So are you!
Johnny.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Dude.  That's my sister.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What?  What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
And reverse the mutations --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
I gave him twenty.
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Susan.  What are you doing?
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
<Me>?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
We'll know -- in the next breath...
With no laser --
But big enough for us...
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
What gives you that idea?
I've done all I could with the laser.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
You left something out.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
It's too late!
At an operation?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
Two in a row?
Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
And she said it was indelible...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
What do you mean?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Jezhush.
We split that.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Uh-huh... A what?
Chaska.
I dunno. Just funny-looking.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Hold on.
Yah.
Ya kiddin'!
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Jerome Lundegaard?
It's okay, Scotty.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Yah.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
We might be innarested.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
We're good to loan in.
Well, that's okay, I just -
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Call 'em up.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Gotta go?
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Margie Olmstead?
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Yah.
They're real good.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
And his wife?
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
He's at -
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
Really, what's that?
Oh.
Look at my face.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
I don't know -- am I?
The girl had done her homework.
You haven't been going to yours.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Here.
I could check your prostate.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Answer the question!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
... You know me?
Is this part of the test?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
There's always that.
...no ...no ...
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
What list?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Can I stay at your place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What fight?
Anyone?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
Same here.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Show-off.
Alive or dead?
That was three times you promised.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Fucking sweet.
Okay, and... and...
Homework assignment.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
Tyler...
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
... is over.
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Defuse the bomb.
What?
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why are you doing this?!
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Appreciate something.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Yeah, how?
You were there?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Should we knock?
He probably already knows we're coming.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
...My Premonition was just like his.
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
No, I'm good.
I can live with thaaaa --
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Let us out!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
I don't.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
I know who you are.
In Death...
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Huh?
That's what I'm here for.
There's a compass in the handle.
Forget it.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Where's his father?
Huntington Beach, California.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Let's go.
How?
What's the job?
What's the plan?
Nice work.
Can you walk?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
No, thank you.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Why this is outrageous!...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Okay.  ... I love you...
And who's Lydia?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
It was a crime.
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
They said you're The One.
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
A quest?
Parry.
Funny -- you look married.
What are you doing?  Give that back!
Well what am I gonna do with it?
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Oh...like Moses.
Yeah.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
No, I...
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm going on over there...
You'll be gone, period.
Who said I was depressed?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
You got any change?
Alaska.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
No. How much do I owe you?
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Now don't...
That's good.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
No, thanks...
Where's Catherine?!
Why?
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
I didn't have any.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
Shut up...
I don't believe vou.
I have to talk to you.
I'll be back later...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
No, I wouldn't.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Well, she was.
Not now, I'm busy
Just get the fuck outta here.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Alright.
What?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
You look good.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
I'll be right down.
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Um, yeah I think so.
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
You here to see somebody?
A girl named Amanda.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Nothing.
You gotta girLfrLend?
Fletch, this is dumb.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
What? What are you talking about?
You're lucky.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
No children?
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Just relax.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
No idea.
For sure?
Fletch...
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Are you serious?
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Where are you going?
What are you doing here?
No problem.
They busted me last week.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Why not?
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sure, all drifters do.
They serve dinner on the flight?
No problem, boss.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Cute thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Hi.
Down boy.
Yes.
God...
Depends on the question.
How come?
Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Gail, please.
They just left, sir.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
In her cabana, sir.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
Muchas gracias.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Moved out.
Irwin...
What about finding the source?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
What?  Who the hell are they?
Not really.
I said, I ain't got you...
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
I'll do my best.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
Johnny's C.D.?
Wha --
Three hundred.
Fluck you!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Ye-ah.
Why have you come to my planet?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Yeah, go on...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
It's your problem.
Si tu veux.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Non!
Il fallait le faire.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
But will they?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
How'd I know he had a knife.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Give who a tail?
Toy wit' this will ya.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Four.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Yeah.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I seem nervous, huh?
You alright?
He ain't the only one.
No.  This isn't what you think.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
Uh, huh.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
You just burned the desk.
What if it's not...
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I think I'm losing you.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I don't understand.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Wow.
You there?
I'm right here, Dad.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
Better.
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Uh, huh.
Sounds good.
So how are things at the hospital?
Yeah, that's right.
I hear that.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
I'll think of something.
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
This is all the exercise I need...
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Don't do that to me!
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Yes.
Stop the car!  Now!!
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Why?
Wait a minute. I just...
That's debatable.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Yes.
The what?
Twenty.
Not so bad, today.
June the 19th.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
That's very colorful, chief.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Sorry.
Her name's Stephanie.
Oh my God, Steven.
About Jessica.
She did!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
Jason...Voorhees?
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Time to check out the waiters.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
Am I? Let's find out.
I don't know what to say...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I heard you weren't coming.
You are going where?
Press a button and they give us money.
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
It's over, finished and done with.
Asbestos lining.
And he was there?
Do we care?
Had to be him.
Does it feel comfortable?
Our Peter?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
About what?
Is it?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Everything.
This building is not secure.
Mystery. Deception.
Two-all after six.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Alma Wetzel.
One more out.
This could be it!
I'm at the door.
It's me. Nicky.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Matthew's my grandson.
That's a simple subject.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
I have excellent long-term memory.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
So does Elliot.
Oh. You know him.
Where are you going now?
Home.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
"Hell!"
Panditji -- please, help me.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That's when you take advantage.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
All right. Fine.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It would be five thousand more.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
Any particular reason?
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
Is that all?
Good choice.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Will you be okay?
Where are you going?
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
German, is that you?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
No.
Why would we do that?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Let's walk.
Only every time I'm in here.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
Antonio--
That's your problem.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Better than old times.
Assumed name... Houston.
Just the way I remembered.
Is he straight?
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
I didn't. I just waited.
I mean it.
Yeah.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
And switched keys.
He must have.
Sure?
You bastard...
Do you mean that?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
When are you going to learn?
Yeah.
We got this far.
Where do we go from here?
I really hope you have a nice trip.
What about the vault?
That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
That right?
That's what matters, isn't it?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
A couple of weeks back.
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Was he?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Christ, what...
That's nice.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
What about?
Though nicer than most?
I call that regular.
I work for him.
Now you're asking.
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice of you to come.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
I left last year.
Thanks.
That's what I was wondering.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Good lad.
Definitely.
My brother, Frank.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
You wouldn't.
No.
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
You're not seeing me?
Shut up.
To get on the...
Well, they fucked it up.
Eh?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
No.
The nurses?
Starting up.
What?
That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
You...
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Somebody...
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
What did you say?
We are?
You're actually talking about this?
Did you talk to Graff?
A buck a shot.
For five thousand?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
What does that mean?
So I'm making it concrete.
Do you need five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I do?
Uh-huh.
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
That's...
He said he filed...
They stole...
What?
Was I?
You have nothing to hide.
Yes.
Where did Moss...?  I...
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
No.
I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Excuse me, sir...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...you didn't close...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
All that I'm saying...
Roma.
The leads are assigned randomly...
Good.  Now we're talking.
No.
Because I say so.
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
That's alright.
Did you tell 'em my sale?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
What?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
What sales?
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
They...
Which...
Home cooking...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Twelve-fifteen.
Mm.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
I don't understand.
And when was that check cashed?
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I can't regotiate.
What...?  Say the words.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You going to turn State's?
Fuck the Machine.
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
Your contract went out to the bank.
Yes.
They were friends.
Why do you have to go?
I can help you.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
Bought at the airport.
The children can stay.
Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
It was hard to have him killed.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
...Who?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
What is it?  Can I help?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
And you believed that story.
I've always taken care of you.
That's not the way we look at it.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
She's gone, Tom.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Alright.
I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
You're right.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Do you owe markers?
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
I don't think that's necessary.
The witness is excused; take him out.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Does it feel like a boy?
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Where?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
Goodbye, Michael.
Who's asking?
Where can we talk?
There are still things I have to do.
But times are different...
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
You were unfair with them.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
I know.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Keep them alive.
No, she's here.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Yes.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
I'm not a kid.
Your wife?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Sorry.  Not today.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
Everybody has stories to tell.
You were a soldier?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
I'm game.  Sure.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I'm very sorry.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You're planning a trip?
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
So what do I do?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
A visitor.
No.  I expect you can't.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
Head.  Not heart.
You didn't?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
What kind of job... ?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
One more night --
Right there -
By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
Let them go --
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
Something like that -
Where you been, anyway?
Well, that defies the point, don't it?
okay ...
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Gray.
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Tuesdays ...
We'll take it.
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
"Shadow games?"
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
The era when crime didn't pay --
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
Hospital.
Mitch.
The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
And Tracy's on the move ...
I dunno. I know a place.
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
She left...
Yeah, I'm cool ...
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
How come ... ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Oh I Him.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
I'm in construction.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Shit.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
It's been six months.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Nah.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
I got dry cleaning.
That's important.
Suck my cock!
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
I don't know.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
Good.
Yeah, it is.
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
I told you "no" yesterday!
I'm Irish.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Retainer...
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
What is it?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Find out what?
Is there someplace we can talk?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got your card.
My kind of background?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Can we do it at my office?
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
I do.
Now wait a minute--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
"Undermine?"
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got one of those too.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
That must have taken you a long time.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
Well, are you going out again?
My wife's dead.
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't want the job.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
What?
Cause fuck him, that's why.
I know.
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Sure.
Okay...
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Not a chance.
I swear to God.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
I'm supposed to understand this.
No.
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
I never cared about that.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
I didn't see nothin'.
Can all of you work?
Why, I guess so.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
That cut you got?
Yeah. On my way home now.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Women is always tar'd.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Oh!
I didn't mean nothing.
What you mean?
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I'd a found you, Ma.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Mad, Ma?
Sometimes they do.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
You promised, Tommy.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They killed Casy first.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
They gone.
But who done it?
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
You do not see either!--not yet!
Won't they ketch us?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
What's this?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
--Stop it--
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Okay. See you later.
Okay.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Watched television?
I'll think about it.
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Like heroin?
Not the other way around...?
It's something I do...
You don't understand...
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Wait a minute--
Patch him through....
They blame you for the compromise.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
It's fine.
What's a revival tent?
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
I have a headache. You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
Mein Dealer.
I have to get my head back into my work.
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
Does Chicago count?
When I was first married.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
She did?
How did you meet her?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
It is. It's lovely.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I don't care.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Little.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Tch. What are you --
How's my pregnant chick!
I love you.
Why?!
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Let's not talk about that now.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
They fired you?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Of course not.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
What does she do?
Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Sure.
How's Pilgrim doing?
Oh yeah...
It's cool!
Alright sir.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
What's this one eat?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Name your stakes.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Okay. I'll copy it.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
I know, I know who wrote it.
I'll hack the Gibson.
What?
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
What's happening?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Joey, Joey...
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
You're late.
Don't get angry.
You don't owe me anything.
We've been better.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Not without Jamie.
Get back!
Brady!
Brady! Come with us.
Yes, sir.
Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Has he been prepped?
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Who you calling?
Well try dammit!
I've got you come on, go down.
Hi Jamie.
I don't want to look pushy.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Why?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
It isn't a man.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
That's not true. Here I am.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Exploring uncharted territory?
He was watching me.
No, he's not.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
I don't want to.
Totally...
Yeah, sure.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Okay. Later.
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.
Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I'm wasting time.
Thorazin.
Only minimum security.
I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
You want to see some?
And then, uh, April...huh?
Mmm.
Oh, it's magnificent!
It feels like you're in France.
Okay.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
What?
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
But I'm seeing him.
And maybe my lawyer.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
This time I really think I have something.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
No!  No...
Well, sure.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
I know!  I know!
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Because he likes you.
Why?
No.
Stop accusing me!
I'm saying it now!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Like what?!  What?
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Okay.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh...
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
Well, then a third opinion.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I should get a garter belt.
Yeah, can you believe it?
So what's new?
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter?
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
No!
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
God!
I remember you.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Have you?
Come on.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, I haven't.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Really?
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, wow!
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
Dad!
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Take our literature...
...read it over, and think about it.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
Some museum director disappeared.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
...how are things at the Hospital?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
That's what <u>you</u> think...
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
They got that kind of money?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
I like Popcorn...
What reaction?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
...what's he got against you?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
...should love to correct your error. 
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
Why did you look at me that way?
How could you know?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Where do you live?
We got KittyKat...
...tell them...
Is it necessary to know?
You were given backup....
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Oh baby, oh baby....
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
And why should we believe you?
What shape is the scar?
I know it well.
...yes, yes, yes....
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no.
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
What are you gonna do about it?
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Your Secret admirer?
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
That's not what I was worried about.
Yes you do.
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Probably.
I'm just thinking I'm glad I broke up with everyone I ever went out with.  The swelling is gonna go down, right?
It's not my style, okay?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Oh yeah, that's it.
Something like that. Will you do it?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
But she couldn't handle it.
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
No.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Incredible similarity.
Of course.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
You didn't say Simon Says.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Let's kick his ass.
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
I'm not hungry.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
I'm stumped.
Okay so... what's the safest place?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
I understand... I won't-
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Really? Do tell.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
But... I thought...
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
In a word? Lucrative.
Really, why's that?
It's perfect.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
I don't work here.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
WHAT?!
LaPlante!
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
The bathroom!  For two days?
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
How recently?
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
Nothin'.
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Turn that thing off.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Lie, you mean...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
Bodybuilding!
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Safety?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
They're really white.
Whoa, check it out.
I'm looking for some perfume.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Who doesn't?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Bye, Neil!
I'm thirsty.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
He'll never appreciate it more.
RUDOLF!
Whew.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Isn't it?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Right over here.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
We don't have any proof of that.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Why?
A few days ago.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
No.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
What?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
What worries you?
No -- after you.
I cannot explain.
Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
In the highlands?
Jennifer.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Is it?
Why don't you tell me.
So?
Sounds very -- normal.
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
What's that next to him?
I like my work.
We'll see.
This cannot be.
How can that be?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
It's happening right now.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Not if they're looking at something else.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
Fuckin' A.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
What do you mean?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Mine, too.
Whatever.
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
I can't go without Thomas.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
He didn't say.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
They've been in there all day.
Where's the office?
We're okay.
I think so.
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
They're still in the house.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
You can let go.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
We, who is we?
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Leave it to me.
Of course.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I don't understand.
They're only taking the whites.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
What did you overhear?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
Your police are at the gate?
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
I committed no war crimes.
I led no massacres.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
That will take time.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
Please, be quiet.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Give him time.
So where is the lamb?
Tell me what it was.
I want to know.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
The staff and guests! How many?
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
Yeah...something.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Yeah, me too.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
The...Fourth of July.
Up here --
Prove it.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
-- where the hell were you?
-- listen to the man --
Back where?
Let's try down here...
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
-- in the act.
Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
And here's your goddamn severance!
I think it's something better experienced then described.
Maybe if I --
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Good way to get your head blown off.
The lockdown thing.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
No!
That poor little girl.
By killing them?
We'll get it later.
She's here.
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
What?
Ok.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Well what do you think it is?
Oh come on!
I think everything's ready.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
I'm all right...
Before.
May I come in?
Did you know her very well?
Why?
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Well what is it!
I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
What happened to him?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Right.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Thank you.
A prize?  For what?
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Something like that.
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
You sound disappointed.
Ooh-kay...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
How long were you in?
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh.  No.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
This is too bad to be false.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
I guess that's a no.
You want an address on that last one?
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
You certainly do.
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Tell me about it...
The Dancing Dingus!
The Jerky Circle!
Snappy.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I'm plenty happy!
Yeah.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
The couch, please.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Well, I --
Oh, is that it!
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
What a beautiful thought.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Sure, Norville, sure...
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
You mean you know about this?
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I don't know...
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
...Geez.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
-- tough titty toenails!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Hmmm.
Not even behind your back?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Well... I'm for it...
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Ti-Joseph?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I imagined this so differently...
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
To the asylum?
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
And as usual no one believed me...
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
That shirt?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
See for yourself.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Good.
Fine.
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Jesus all right enough!
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
C'mon.
Darn it, Dave.
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
With Mikey?
Who?
Mikey Williams?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
Ouch.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
What?
Just be careful.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
The Idiot?
Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Sure, anything but this English.
Sure.  Twinkie?
There's a TV in the basement.
You get in trouble?
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Is this Charles?
And?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
One more shot?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Too bad...
That must have been awful for you.
Anything.  It's important.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
What time was that?
So?
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
To do nothing.
He's just rattling your cage.
Will?
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
What is it?
After that she left the party to go to him.
You don't know.
You're not missing much.
He.  Well, he...
Congratulations.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Louis, I swear I did not.
No.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
I want a woman.
You have fed. You were made for this...
Do you think so?
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
As did the one who made me.
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Are you mad????
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
He did it to make you stay with him!
My daughter...
What about a radio?
What are you doing in my closet?
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Okay, I won't.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
What do we do?
...Nancy?
I told you.
I don't know.
You don't seem fine.
Are you sure?
He's in it with Willis?
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
Well, I'm in school and --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
You don't have to be a jerk.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
It was, the plague
You wouldn't tell that ——
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
She's not too well.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Oh, now —— now look here ——
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
I shall not leave the island ——
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
I'm hurrying.
Don't . . . George?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Sit down? What are . . .
That's your problem, George Bailey.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Hi, Bert.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Today, over at the house.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Fine.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
A cattle boat?
I'm all right.
And all's fair in love and war?
Ummmm . . .
Oh, George.
Hope you enjoy it.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Nothing.
Where are you going?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
George . . .
They're not my children.
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Have you notified the police?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Me?
Didn't you tell her?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Thank you.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Hi.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Left them at the office.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Oh, shucks . . .
I want to go faster!
I'm supposed to.
No.
We better go back in.
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Gangway, Turkies!
Let's just go sailing, okay?
What is it?  What's there?
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Positive I.D.?
That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You heard me.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
Hey, come on....
What else you got?
Too late, it's written.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
The what?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
It's good with coffee.
So's a donut.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
No.
That's great.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Because of today?  The beach?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Just one minute....
Going out.
I know, I know....
Maybe they are!
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Waiting for Andy.
Nope.
I know.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Next week.
Give me back my hat!
Power line.
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Might as well.
Yeah.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
Hope I make it through both.
I guess.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
That we swim.
Up.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Yes?
How's your patient?
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
So?
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
I am.  You're not.
But you --
You don't have to prove anything.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Why?
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Thanks for helping.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
Sure.
'Preciate it.
'Course they're also so rich.
Sure am.
He's diving!
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Hey.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Reach for the limit I always say.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Right, Mike.
Got a job for me?
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
Nowhere....
We need beer....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
Then don't come any closer.
They're at the beach....
We're going down.  All of us....
Mommy lets me....
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
You guys must be starving....
You were a monkey....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Why'd you take the boat?
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It could have been an accident....
Sure you can....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I have coffee in the thermos.
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
You got a better idea...?
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
They won't fight with me....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
What?
We got it together, Jake....
The shark will get it for us.
Shit....
You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
Maybe it's gone....
I'm going down, Jake....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
Only me and Mom ..
How about any guys on your staff?
Not too good in daylight ..
There's nothing in the files?
How'd you do it, old man?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
No.
What are you looking for?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
No.
Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
It was probably the wind.
Pray?
He said that? What else did he say?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
Why does he want to kill me?
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
A derelict.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Jerry!  Do something --
Listen to me, it's over.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
No no. I knew.
Call me later, hon.
Good evening.
I'm relieved you said that.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
Oh good.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Easy, easy --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Okay... I will...
You want...
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I don't like to give up.
What about Ray?
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Thank you.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Okay.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
I'm a little worried --
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Gorgeous.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Oh no -- _ 14.
Don't be silly.
Pleasure.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Dick.
You'll lose.
Jerry --
No.
Hi Ray.
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
This is how you play God.
One way to find out.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
You hate to swim.
Nothing.
We have to help him.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I would completely support that.
Dr. Grant was.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
I don't believe you.
John . . .
I want to see the nesting ground!
I don't even know this woman.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
That was about a year ago.
Good lad.
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
Why?
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
You're going too?
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
John Hammond.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
What?
Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
No.
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
These are dilated.  Take a look.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Could I have a tissue please?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
What kind of park is it?
Say again?
Dilophosaurus.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Like hell it is!
I know, it's very exciting.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
In a box under my seat.
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Listen, ahh - -
Whichever one you are.
Really?
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Yes it is.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Nope.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
For a further three years.
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Yes.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Sure.
Excellent.
Great.
Fuck you.
His camera... it's still recording.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
He's fucking nuts.
He wets the bed?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
Success or nothing?
A man must eat --  And drink.
Yes.
What an extraordinary request!
It's my last and final one.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
When I have no reason to doubt.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
He was murdered.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
-- Listen to me --
Your office is the Workmen's --
Eight -- and seven months.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
What makes you think so?
-- You should meet my father.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
Orlac is an account?
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
Oskar.
She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
And we're upset too.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Oh my God ... Ann?
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
What was it, Jack?
Kong ...
What about him? Yes.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
I guess he figured it was better.
No, that's not --
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Yes -- all right --
-- Yes.
Will you let me go then?
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Yeah.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
With Trina.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Well as a matter of --
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Town Police.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
Yes sir, we know he --
Not particularly.
On earth.
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
Goodbye.
Sorry.
I guess...
I'm sorry.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I'm allergic to onions.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
No!
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sure.
It's my name too.
Sure.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Why does he decide?
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Yes...
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Yes.
No.
No.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Do you?
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
Fine.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Any prospects?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
I don't know.
John, what if she kidnaps him.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
California?
What?
Uh, huh...
Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Please, Thel...
It is alright, Father.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
What do you think?
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
Where is Alsace?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Britain chooses not to.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Thank you.
Always.
I have smarter men.
Am I running away?
I will miss you.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
How could I ever leave?
Hmm.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Go ahead.
I need to see his habitat.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I don't know!
Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
You do?
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
Just those two.
I'm just saying last resort.
As if.  Will you miss me?
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I didn't say it like that.
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Let's get away from the shore.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Alright, Jack!
Good idea.
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
You wanna ride in my truck?
No.
Good thinking.
So does he.
Where is he?!
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
I can look at dead things.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Not yet.
Was he swallowed?
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
I asked you to be nice to him.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Look ten feet into the water.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
I want you to go there.
Kelly--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Lecter said a lot of things.
What girl?
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Jack Gordon.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
And what is that, sir?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Point taken.
What would it take?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Starling -
Not lately. But maybe someday.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
No, I came because we need -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
No. You ate yours.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Ahhh... Why?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Mmm. And what else...?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Horses - and sheep...
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
You know I can't make that promise.
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
You have my word. Paul?
Did you breast-feed her?
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
There was none!
You do not know what you are saying!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
It can be dangerous...
...Fort William Henry.
I don't understand!
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
That's all, sir.
By your leave, sir.
Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
And this?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Crunch...Implosion.
No way...
No!
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
Where's Jones?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
What's wrong with it?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Beautiful.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Russian.
Itches like hell.
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Two hundred meters.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
It's hit us all hard!
I'll think of something, don't worry.
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
You get the guns?
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Can I help?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
No.
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Plank?
He means they're thieving dogs.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
I'll only be a minute.
A hundred grand.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
I think you're Nick the Greek.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
How many wings have they got between them?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Do whatever they tell you--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
A .45--
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
I never met her.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
My mother said he never asked about--
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
You know who I am?
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
PDA?
Something like that.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
Cliff--
Maybe.
Pleased to meet you.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
Substance abuse?
You get much of that in here?
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Right.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
--Santiago.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
I got an idea what happened.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
No. Is he sick?
What was your deal with him?
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
Of course you can.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Yeah?
What do you think?
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Got him here?
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I mean what did we know about anything?
More, I hope.
What was your father's name?
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
I'm going over to the other side.
They got telephones.
Oh.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You'd do a good job.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
Yeah. It's quiet--
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Name's Otis.
Uh-huh.
I know that.
You believe that?
Thirty-five bucks.
Nix.
Nix?
Who is he?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
You heard right.
You ever been married?
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
That's so cool.
You'll do more.than that.
What is he?
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
Why?  Because he had you?
That's my business. Harry.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
It was more than that, I think.
Hang on!
I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Out!  Out!
I left three messages already.
Oh God.
No.  I'm not going near him.
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
Go away.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Probably.
When will she be in?
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
What about?
I won't say anything.
Does anybody?
Who is he?
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Sure.  Vivovich.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Is that all?
I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
I got to go.  I'm late.
What?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Why would I want to?
Liar!
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
Yeah, I'll stay.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Two years.
Ok.
Charlotte, who?
OK, see you downstairs.
No, its easy.
I don't know.
No, I was looking at you.
No, yes, it does...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
And marriage, does that get easier?
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
You are.
Because that would be too easy.
Do you know where we are?
No.
No, we'll find something around here.
A coke.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Yes, no.
Well... have a good flight.
Can I enter?
Yes?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
Oh, come on.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Ok.
One moment, please.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
It'll just be a few days.
Sure.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
When did they find her?
Yeah, like...
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Eight.  That okay?
Seemed...on edge.
No, I wasn't, actually.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
I do.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
I'll bet.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I'm going to look around.
What's the...OH SHIT!
What?
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
That's ridiculous.
You want the job or not?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Huh?
I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
Then I'll get you some punch.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
You could make a career by telling me where.
You might be the only one with a job.
I don't know sometimes.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
Just wanted to say good game.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't know.  A lot.
A ride home.
Didn't know you cared so much.
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Yeah.
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Clothes.
Right here.
I've been trying to find you all day.
It happens, right...
You weren't at my game.
Woman...
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You're what?
Funny.  I never did.
No.
you woke me up to tell me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Yeah.
Said he'd be home later.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
What mess?
Still is, so let yourself out.
Came by to check on you.
Look, I'm busy.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
You want me to fuck off?
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
Honey.
Did you hear what I said?
No.
About two years ago.
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Thank you.
yeah, good, ok.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Really?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Why not?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
...yeah...
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
What?
ok.
I lost my gun.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
You don't know how crazy I am.
What's your name?
Diet Coke.
Have you ever been there?
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
DAD.
Sorry, little man.
I'm a rapper.
What's up?
Well --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Brad, dear?
-- Samuel Johnson.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I paid you back.
Braces?
It's...doesn't matter....
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Do me a personal favor --
Jack.
...Lily...?
No.
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Yep.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
She's retired.
...this close...
In five years?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
...are you Phil...?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Uh. huh.
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
There's no disturbance.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I didn't hear anything.
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
Yeah. Yes.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
Do you love me, Rose?
Was there anyone that I know?
Well maybe.
Maybe...I don't...
Are you on drugs right now?
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Bottled Water?
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
I need this one.
Should be one-thirty.
I didn't know the answer --
I said I'm fine.
Hi.
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
And you were not hurt?
No, stay back!  Stay back!
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
We must stop him!
But -- but --
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
I know.  God go with you.
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
Who came?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
Yes, your Majesty.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Oh Louis, Louis...
We're by Ozone...
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Fine -
And he took a swing at you?
Did he harm the girl?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
What?  Wait a minute -
You got any family?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
What else is new?
Both at the same bank...
I'm going to need a way to get there.
What?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Last two like this we had, you caught.
These are all dead, Will.
I know...
To recover the mind set.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
There's no connection between the families.
What's that?
See if there's another label underneath.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
It's happening again, Jack...
When do you need it?
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Do you see?
Please, no.
Are you a man?
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
No.
I don't think I'll tell you.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He only bit women so far, right?
What's average?
What about the dog?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Come home with me.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
That's not true.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
That's right.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house...
Are you George Sherman?
...after a while.
Stuart is fine.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
You're insane.
Yes.
Yes. I'd considered it.
Yes.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
George, I hate sitcoms.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Hi George!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
There'll be other shots.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Really?
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
I don't wanna talk about it!
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Then your father's a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Yes, your Holiness?
It is apparently not working.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.
Oh shit.
The orders were for your protection.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
I got you.
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
We have no choice.
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Why not?
The Matrix?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
I think I do.
Yes.
What did she tell you?
That I would find the One.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
We're on our way --
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
Shit, I'm sorry.
What?
What?
Who is?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
Why?
Should I be?
You can't!
Do what?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
How?
Dozer?
Nothing's private...
I gotta get the stuff.
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Kennedy.
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
There won't be any this week.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I understand.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Good idea.
No.
For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Get him in.
That's nice.
Stripper?
Chinese food?
Nothing.
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
It's all right.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Did you?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
But...
Come on.
Yeah, it's your father's.
You mean it's heisted.
You ate?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
A name?
I don't like cake.
'Goddam party'!
Yes, it is.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
You mean this, sir?
Right away.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
A voice?
'Yes'.
You have a way with words.
Yes.
Uh -- he's from out of town --
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
My Doctor Lady?
I am.
Don' need you okayin'.
Hi, Jennifer.
Yes?
How did you meet?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
What do you mean 'free'?
Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
I am Joe.
Do you love Drew?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Not now.
Girlfriend?
Gay?
No.
'To bed'?
-- I guess you haven't.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I am.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
More than you love peanut butter?
Where are you going?
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
'Threw' you?  Where?
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
How long have I got?
Not at all.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Yes.
I don't understand.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Of course.
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
You were just curious?
You tell me, Bill.
What's okay?
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
This universe?
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Which is what?
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An indictable offense.
You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
I didn't ask any question.
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
'Take me'...?  Where?
Get what?
Time.
How're you doing--?
It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Yes, but --
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
Hi, Leonard.
When was I in here?
Interested in buying one?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Strip!
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You did explain, Lenny.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Sorry.
Just relax.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What are you gonna do?
I'll go see him.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
I have this condition -
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Don't protect him.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
What do you want?
Teddy!
No! Should I?
I don't know.
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Like what?
Why not?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I thought so too! I was sure you'd				* remember. But you didn't.					    *
Lemon or lime?
What's your twenty?
Good.
What do you think?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
We're not certain!
They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Where's she now?
Died in childbirth, having me...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
I know.  And now?
Sit.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Stevens?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
On my way back...
Havana, Cuba...?
I am asking.  You to me.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Never heard of him.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Alonzo...!
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
"Salutations from the south..."
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
They lied.
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Lotta rich women back there...
I know. Scribbage!
For money.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
What of?
They gotta be.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Sounds like they knew you.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
I'm going to Florida.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Ready for hard work, son?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Get down -- where?
Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
... and taxi fare for me.
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
You want to split your hernia again?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
For the money... )
I know.
Oh Jesus! 
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
What's your father do?
A hundred grams.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Where is it?
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
Yeah? Where?
What?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
We?
Maybe they lied to you.
No, there's...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
That's camouflage...
Jump in.
I can.  We can do this...
Gross. What is it?
She used a baster.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
What are they...?
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
I don't have a title yet.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Misery?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
I'm...
Perfect.
You want me to burn my book?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Great.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
C'mere, I'll show you.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Well, it certainly says you.
I think you're right.
It is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Be my guest.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
I'm almost done.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Maybe you can, Libby.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two-two point two million.
What can we do' mate?
Uh-huh.
- torque wrench.
- right..
At least you walked.
You didn't do that badly.
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Which is?
Damn, you're beautiful.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
And six billion in the world.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just like old times?
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Like what?
What did you think of him?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
She must still be on the property.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
They'll kill me.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Fold it.  Fold it tight.
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
May take a little time.
I'm walking.
There was nobody on the bridge.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Ethan?
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Certainly Ethan.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Mm - Hmmm...
Very good.
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.
Higher.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
I guess.
- and picked us up in the States -
Of course I can hear you.
I always check the batteries.
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
And go to confession.
You did this once it didn't work out.
Maybe.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
That's it.
He knew my husband who died.
Bus hit him.
No.
Yes.
What are you doing!
A bride without a head!
It makes you look like an angel.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
For what?
Yeah. It smells like snow.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I'm afraid of who I am.
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
I'm freezing to death.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
Yeah, I'll be in.
Johnny.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
On the floor?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
How was your plane ride?
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Oh.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
It's late.
Yes.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
Good.
Definitely!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
It's nothing!
Go ahead.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
No.
Good night.
You mean the whole house?
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
I knew she had it.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Did you dress her up like this?
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Burn them.
I'm not interested.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Well, how did you become king, then?
Oh!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Come on you pansy!
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Well, what are you then?
My liege,  I am honored.
OF course, my Liege ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Oh, just some friends!
You know my name?
Follow!
What?
There he is!
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Come on, patsy.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
Good idea, O Lord!
Course it's a good idea.
The nose?
You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I can't take him.
Why?
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
But I don't like her.
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
I'm ... your son ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Leaving the room.
Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Is that clear?
You are in great peril.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
Ector.
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
Don't say that word.
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
I speak as I find, Archie.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
What?
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Be careful who sees it.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Back and upper corridors.
That can wait till the weekend.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
If you hunt, you kill.
I wouldn't know.
I do what I do.
Ma'am.
And the pony?
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Then why send me back to them?!
Well, both.
You can't know that for sure.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
Not too protracted, I hope.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Why?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
No, in person.  Now.
No way.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
And beat it at it's own game.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Everything.
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
One.  In case...
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Well, it's a long story...
Is that your question?
You have no time.
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
It's been a very strange day.
You gotta be kidding?
And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
What did I say?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Yes, there was.
May I have your name please?
Diane?
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
I don't know who I am.
"So... surprise"...
I'm all right.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Do you know them?!
No, we don't.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Yes, Sir.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny's.
Okay. Why this Denny's?
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Making ends meet, huh.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Why should I ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Is this really the time ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Okay.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Bye....
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Because of my charming personality ?
Look...
Ow...
Don't have to tell me twice.
Yes, sir Mom. 
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
No.
So ?
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Yes sir.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
We can't afford too many surprises.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
The power went out in half the park.
How can this happen ?
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Shut up ! It's me.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
We made it !
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
I don't even know your name.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Well you know what I mean.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Seriously?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Was it a nice funeral?
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
What??
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I will. How's Shelly?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
More than anything in the world.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
I guess you have.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I'm sure she did. 
There's water in your bathroom.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
He is one of the great poets.
And I thought I was weird.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
DON'T, come on!!!
Uh oh...
Oh no?!?!?!
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Committed.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Sounds like you're very organized.
You know how I feel about you.
She'll be all right baby.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
You have no idea.
O.K.
You're such a baby.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Pardon?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Okay.
What's that?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
What?
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Feeding my fish.
He's okay isn't he?
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Sure.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Oh.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Can we look around in your camper?
Mostly love, and romance.
Come here, sit down.
Oh great!!
Goodnight.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
Hurry!
No, I don't wanna.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Hurry!!!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
You're butting in.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Sure.
Major.  Dish.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Good girl.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
... look good on Kimberly.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
Waiter! Check, please!
Firenze.
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
If you like.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
A bad combination.
She admits it's her fault.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Lower.
I came here, looking for her.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
If you find her...
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
What is that sup...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
What?
Is there food?
I see.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
She's fine.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
His Word.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
National?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
She sure sings nice.
I'm not really a musician.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Get in.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
The car broke down.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
I don't think so.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Who is this?
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I've got a gig tonight.
Oh?
Wrong.
I'm not sure.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yes.
You sound different. Is that really you?
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
An album.
Mary?
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
How long have you been together?
Where is she?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Yes you are.
That's what Tim said.
You got something you want to do?
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Thank you, sir.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Yours.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Says who?
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Yeah, we have a van.
Out front.
Got it.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
You made every day like kindergarten.
And a snake-eye glare.
Yes.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Scotty?
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Slate it.
They're mesmerising.
Why?
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Really?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
It sure is.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Well, what d'you know?!
What d'you think?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
No. I'm new in town.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
No.
Go on - you can have one!
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
Four.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Huh?
What about your boy?
About ten dollars.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What the hell could you do?
Watch out!
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Like what?
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Wouldn't have known you.
Yeah. That's right.
'Don't sound so sure.
Great.
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
How often is that?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess not.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
I know.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
You hate Raoul?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
How's the villa's security?
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
And how do you suggest I do that?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
You son of a bitch...
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
What are you talking about?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
All things possible in Babylon.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Maybe so...
You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
It's coming.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Case.
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
No!... No...
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Where did you here that?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Almost two days.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
It sounds like you.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Something exotic I hope.
...And if I guess wrong?
No we don't...
Hold on.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
What?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Who told!
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
Five-- Six--
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
Hey--I can be out of control.
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Dude, you rock!
Yeah, you gonna be there?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
See!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Don't you remember what they called you?
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Is that true?
Yes, desperately.
That's the spirit!
And a gymnast!
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Don't look down!
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I know.
You were attracted to me?
Why?
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Barrel.
And heavy...
Why not?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He's dead, you bitch.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Yeah, why?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Let me look at your eye...
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
I don't know.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
C'mon, cut it out.
I'll get over it.
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You want to talk about it?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
There's nothing to figure out.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Sure...go ahead.
All of them.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'm serious.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can't it wait till morning?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
Sure.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Anything?
What's that supposed to mean?
Call me Nancy.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
I can do that.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
And what are they?
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
I'm delighted.
Oh, stop showing off.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
No thanks.
Thanks.  Well...
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Oh -- Okay.
Yes.
If that's all right.
Okay.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Nothing.
Yes, you did.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
Your boyfriend?
Come in.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Eleven.
Yup.
Well, get a message through to him too.
What do you think?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Right.
Okay.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Oh.
Stay forever.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Well... how have you been?
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
The truth is...
Nice surprise.
I haven't decided.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
He wouldn't say.
Yes.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Shame!
Da Vinci?
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ahm... Bernie.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Who?  Someone famous?
No, it doesn't.
Do you ever masturbate?
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
No, no.  She doesn't.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Two?  That's it?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Maybe.
Spike!
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Oh sure.  Of course.
Fabulous.
Yes.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Thank you, ma'am...
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
So long, kid.
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand?
Are they all crazies?
Lend me twenty.
Let me get on your shoulders.
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Right, Mack!
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
My feet hurt...
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
I'm busting outta this place.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
Hit me.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay!
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Yeah, what's up?
What are they?
Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Big man!
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Yes, ma'am...
Thank you, ma'am,
How 'bout twenty?
Now you talkin'.
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
Your hair... is perfect.
Exactly.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
What?...
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Thanks.
Non.  Please.
Hm.
Who's this?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Where's Positano?
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
What?
So were you.
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
Hi.  Are you... busy?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Sure is.
You would?  Really?
Yes?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
So?...
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
I don't know, Kate.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
I know...  It was.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Because you were afraid to fly.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
What?
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
What if he doesn't like me?
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
I didn't expect you back so soon.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I'd love to.
That's exactly what you are.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Mania.
I'm gonna take her home first.
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
That was the idea.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Maybe.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Terry... Terry... .
They play pretty rough.
I'll get home all right now.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
How would you've done it?
Do you like pigeons?
How do you like that one?
Oh she's a beauty.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
You?
I know what you want me to do!
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Every one of 'em... .
Terry...?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
I don't want to hear it in there.
Mind your own business, Father.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Yeah, really!
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
No?
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
What do you mean?
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
I am--It's our only chance.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
When!?
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Then cancel my order.
For what!?!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Aaaahhhh.
When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
Aaarrrgggaahh.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Who is it?
What?!
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
No, thanks.
He called the day he escaped.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
She's coming with us.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
You at least bring the gun?
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Love is funny.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
Jack --
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
In the trunk, yeah?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Wait.  You not Adele?
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
That's right.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You don't act like it.
Peter Finch.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I can go to the bar.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
I don't have a problem with it.
Where?
Outside Adele's.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You know who they are?
Must be a real soft pillow.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
You gonna write me a check?
Five point two.
Meaning time came, I left.
You busted out?
The <u>ninth</u>?
She did, huh.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
I <i>was</i>...
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
No.
Then they're not separated, are they?
What're you doing at Glades?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
I really gotta go.
We don't get to talk much any more.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
I don't have any idea.
The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Yes Sir.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Yeah.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
...He said that?
From the air?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
Then wh-where do we land?
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
Have the planes made it to China?
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Would you?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
He's trying.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
Who?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Come back to me.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
You don't?
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
What a treat.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Way to go, Mom!
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Sort of.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I don't know.
You're giving me the creeps.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I... um...
Pretty much so.
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
I suppose so.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
It's been a few years.
I still can't believe she's dead...
I'm not hungry.
I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Anywhere but here.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Zowie.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Allright. Calm down.
Andy?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I promise!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
Whatever.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Congratulations.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
As in, the vegetable?
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Find a lawyer?
Not bad.
Sure. It's fine.
What?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Opera?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Yes. On my torso.
Thank you.
Sure thing.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
No.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Objection.
Were you recently promoted?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
That's correct.
You're in trouble.
What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
On behalf of the defendants?
Beckett?
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
Charles...
'Mean the whispers?
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
But they...they could still be....
Like the light is scalding it.
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
That's what I said.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
What the hell's it matter?
How much?
What, you're goin' off, too?
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
Quiet, please. Everyone.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Do what I say. Please.
Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Well, what's it look like now?
Just realized that, huh?
Not if I'm the one.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Just the same, I want one.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
It's probably wrong --
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
That way.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
I'm for that.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
What is it?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course.
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
You want her that much?
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Taylor, you can't.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
But there's the doll, sir.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Yeah but I still like a piece of pussy once in a while - ain't nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the Indie 500.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
...beautiful night.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
What are you talking about! 
Found it. Growing in a garden.
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Thank you.
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
Okay. You win.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
As I said before...
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
That's putting it mildly.
You don't know who he is?
No use waiting, then.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
They're going to arrest me.
I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
Frozen.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Including Killaine.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?
Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
I'm sorry.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Very ridiculous.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
You do things the hard way, don't you?
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
For five hundred, what do I get?
For two hundred?
And without much discrimination.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
If I can get off.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
You nasty, sardonic--
Convenient, isn't it?
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Go live in a tent.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
You can find out.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
So?
Oh nothing.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Not if it clears the air.
How do you do, sir.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Why should I mind?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Thank you.
Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
And I didn't like that man.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
How nice.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
He's all right, the professor.
Might?
To the airlift.
Not yet you know any of these people?
To the Fleet.
Let me see.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
Oh yes.
The torture of small children--
All right.
They don't count.
I'm not here.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
'Night.
Not yet.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
You never were...
Yes, sir.
Zero distortion, sir.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
That's the point, isn't it?
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Sure.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Thank you, Sergeant.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
No.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
What's that?
New York.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
You couldn't afford it.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Don't drown.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
You're forgiven.
You liked the guy, though.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Come with me?
Ready to stomp sod?
I really am sorry.
I more than liked it.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It was a business decision.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
No.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
It was great.
Dummy.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
What if they serve soup?
Then you would use your--
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
It's very expensive.
I think it's great.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
Then why bother curing me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I do not marry tonight.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
I will never doubt again.
What?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
How many could you handle?
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Right, right, sorry.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I don't understand.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
What's that?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Get used to disappointment.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I smell nothing.
Hmm.
Think it'll work?
Maybe he won't.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Congratulations.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
"Of the silvery moon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Well, sir, it seems ...
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
But that's cheating!
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
What did I do?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What???
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Maybe you're happy.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
We swear it!
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Ta.  Ta.
Wagner...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Where are you going vit the light?
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.
No one met her?
No.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Casharoonie!
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Five hundred.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Just what he told your detective.
Sure...
Where?
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I hate tears. 
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
An hour! Or less!
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Just wait here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
You're not.
I believe it.
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Los Angeles.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Thank you. Again.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Only my share.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
You should... mind it.
To a private island, like you?
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Alright, Miss... 
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Why?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Norman took a wife?
I didn't think so.
Do what?
Leave me alone!
Shut up! Shut up!
This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
I'm going to call the police.
How? What can I do?
Go to sleep!
The master ... is asleep!
There's no child here.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'm not quarreling, only ...
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
What do you think I am?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Here's a wow.
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
I'm heading out of town.
A quantum one.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
What was your mother like?
Well, yeah.
The girl strikes like a cobra.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Daddy, what's the matter?
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
What did you say, Brother?
No.
Buddy, that was my place.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Is her husband sick or something?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
No, son, she is dead.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
The hell we can't.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
Who?
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Yes, sir.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Well, it's Billy.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Your baby?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Afraid of the hospital?
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
You can stop it right now.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
More history, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
But... I love him.  I do...
You're not gonna see him again.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
I need the "when" and the "where."
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
We'll share.
Relax.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What about him?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
It's not gonna happen.
Wha... ?
No, we're stealing.
Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
We've got the tape to prove it.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Shit.  You're right.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Gimmie a minute.
Sounds good.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
All right. Stand by.
But I have no sister.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
You, too.
Good, I hate long waits.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
We shall double our efforts.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Tell me.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
I will not fight you.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Uh huh.
Oh...
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Weiss.
I hope so my darling.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
So come up to the Lab.
Was all I had to say
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
Ohh!
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, I do.
Yes.
I think he might be worried.
They're all the same.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Don't want weak legs.
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Don't talk like that to him!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Does that bum have to say that?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
What's happenin' here?
That's it? -- Completely?
Ya sure?
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
Black market?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
...What?
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Here's the card?
Freak luck for sure.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
...Shrewd.
Creed's great.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Hey --
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
...Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
What?
Whatta these guys want?
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Maybe --
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
R.K. Maroon.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Bastards put him on notice.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Oh, no...
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Doom.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Divorce?  Never!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
My brother.  Get inside.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Is the day so young?
Out--
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Romeo, come forth.
She'll not come down tonight.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
I take thee at thy word.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If my heart's dear love--
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
A most courteous exposition.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
NO! Mercutio!
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Do you really think so?
Leaving...
I don't know.
Which leads us to...
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not yet...
Just business.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
Of course.
Enough!
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
A means to an end, is that it?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Is that right?
Who else would you be?
Same thing, isn't it?
There is that.
So is the woman.
I wanted to see who you were.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You see the bullet?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Business keeps you on the road?
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
You better get some sleep, alright?
I guess that's for the best.
Gonna be tough.
Doing well.  This is?
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I might know where you could get a copy.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Why?
Because...I know.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
It's the right thing to do.
You killed him...
You don't know if he was really gonna --
No we're not.
My point, well...
No.  Why?
Because someone may have gotten away.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Denning was wearing a bug.
OK.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Thanks for your time.
This just might be our ticket!
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Did you say After Midnight?
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Is that the mail?
At least around here it does.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
There was more than that.
So...what's the good news?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
Carter, would I lie to you?
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
You.
Not Yu.  You!
I'm okay, you go.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Forget it.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
You sound like that all the time.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Why did you help me?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Are you serious?
End of the line.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
No problem.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
This money is evidence.
The Plaza Hotel?
Some Kung-Pao?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Baby Duck?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
Tell me about it.
So was I.
A little.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
No. I just made it up.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
What do you hear?
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find Œem.
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Nobody touches me.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
You don't understand this guy.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Of course.
Of course.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Thanks.
And you defending her?
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Twice...
Six-fifty.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
What!?
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
So, we'll...
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
This is getting serious.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Would it?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Not eight...
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
You don't love me, is that it?
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
That doesn't make any sense.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
About forever.
It was my mother's.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
So what happened?
Look!
About what?
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
What?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
He lost all the weight... there.
Made for each other.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Why me? What about Jay?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
No.
Right, right.
You'll like it.
Somewhere in the middle.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
I know.
How do you know?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I don't know.
Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
This is a good letter, Dad.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
She's going to cook something for us?
Yes.
This is the one I like.
No.
It was all they had.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
Never... never... never!
Aaah, what's the use?
I did forget. Luís told me.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Backward.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
You know I don't think that.
You mean Delaware?
No ...
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Shhh.
The spiders.

They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Everything go?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
I don't want to.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
How?
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
You on a roll?
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You're going to have to explain that one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
When? When did you ever see me use?
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
No, I'm good.
I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
If you say so.
Why do you say that?
Big Bill.
Big Bill
Okay! Okay!
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
My name is Tom.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
To who?
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
You mean the menacing red car?
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
A private, sir?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Thank you, sir.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Figured.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
I guess.
What deal?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
I'd love to hear it.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
Sarge?
I don't expect to live that long.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
But, sir...
Goddamn it, sir...
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I've got a line on one.
Good news?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Is it getting worse?
How about you take your position?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Yeah.
I know.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
That's a mystery to me.
HERE THEY COME!
Get back to your positions!
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Yeah?  So?
Get lost.
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
I hope you understand.
I'll be home soon.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
C'mon Lloyd.
That's just so embarrassing.
I admit nothing.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
I am.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
I dream about it.
I can accept that.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Now why can't I tell the story?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
I'm fine.
I know that.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
I like him a lot.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, I love him.
I swear to god.
Honey, about what?
Yes, I...
Look at those eyes.
Yeah?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Pardon me?
I'll go.
Would you hold this for me?
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Watch out for that glass.
Basic.  Hmmm.
No, I'm serious.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Come on.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Your letter came yesterday.
It did?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
One more time would be nice.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
Very talented.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Yeah, sure.
I just told you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Yeah, I can.
That's great, thanks.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Yes.
Stern.
There will be generations because of what you did.
You did so much.
We're aware of that.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
I live here.
Can we talk?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
It helped me realize one thing.
No, I don't.
You’re all in this together?
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
No way.
You freakin?
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
It's under control.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
That’s quick.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I got it..
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Tails.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
But who would operate your camera?
I don’t know.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
..harmonica style is okay.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Do you work for her now?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Asshole, Can't talk.
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Did you request this case?
Excuse me?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
What?  When?
No.
What?
No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
What?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Honestly, my life.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
What the hell are you doing?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
They're the ones who approved it.
Yeah.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What?  What movie?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
No, it's not.
Where the fuck did she go?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
Yes, sir.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Oh Sidney...
Are you serious?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
To apologize.
Who is this?
You have to have a favorite.
No.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
Don't...
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Guess.
Then he dies. Right now.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
YES!
No it's not. It was Jason.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
Mind if I join you?
Yes, you doofus.
Hold up a sec...
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
He's her boyfriend.
Drive by patrol.
How is she?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Have you contacted the bureau?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Many times.
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
What am I doing?
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
You got it.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
It's all part of the game.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Later.
I bet he's pissed.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
I'm in.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
So what?  This victim...
You know.
He's not finished.
It would be too hard.
Okay...
NO!
You'll see.
A woman...
Delusions of grandeur.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Nothing.
It's got to be.
Just wait!
No.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
You can't go in there.
Think about how we got here!
One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I will.
There's no time to discuss it!
Don't do this... please...
What?
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I don't know.
Huh...? No...no water.
No sir...pleasure.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
I'm Clayton.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I've come now...
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Good night.
He just couldn't wait...
Whatchu doin'?...
Cut it out, will ya...
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Never heard of him...
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
So do I, believe me.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
Just call me Elisabeth.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Tomorrow.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
See you in jail.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
That's me.
Put his feet in.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
God be praised!  Locked?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
As a nurse.
What do you love so much?
Your Majesty
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
Is she obedient?
I have, Master Shakespeare.
You admire it?
Oh. What is your name?
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
You can bring them with a word.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Then I will go with you.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
Orsino…good name
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
You call them if you want.
I won't be able to.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I want to talk now.
I don't know.
Not eating what?
If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Your friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well?
No. Why should it?
What?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Yes.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
For the flat.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
You're right.
So I gathered.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Open it.
Yes.
What are you doing?
No.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I don't want to. It's different.
No, no, it's different.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
David?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Oh.
I refuse.
We were just sorting things out.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
What about?
Downstairs.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Two hundred pounds.
What?
If I think you're lying --
You and me?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
And he's a patient of yours?
No. But he needs treatment.
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
That sounds fine.
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
What?
What do you expect me to do about it?
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
She did?
It turned out to be cancer.
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Are you?
God, I adore you.
No thanks.
Making it with my mother?
Yeah...
Then what do you think?
You are.
You are.
Yeah.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
I guess not...
I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
Buffums?
Probably the bathroom.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Yeah, baby...
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
What are you talking about?
-- we can't now.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You don't think so? I do.
-- what?
Lester's on his way.
Well then what are you trying to do-
I can't just let him stand by the door...
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
What's gonna happen?
I just... who what?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Okay.
I'll call you.
When is that, George?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
Bullshit.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
What difference does it make?
That's all you've got to say?
George...
Yes, yes, I did.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Sure.
Okay.
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
What can I say!
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Okay, thanks.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
She's nothing but a whore.
No.
No.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Who were you talking to?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Of course not.
What's that?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
That's right.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
He's a hairdresser.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Do you have something against traveling?
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Yes?
What was the Donner party?
Okay.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes?
Tony.
Do they know he tell you things?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Yeah.
I won't make any noise.
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
I won't, Mom.
Danny, come here!
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Yes.
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
All right, sir.
Sure.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
I hope it's nothing serious.
Uh...huh.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
Yes.
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Wendy...
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Well, my predecessor in this job
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Oh!
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Uncle Al-
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Stop it!
Jane, I have to talk to you.
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
What?
Huh?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Was it a prescription?
Marty, do you see your suspect?
I told you!
There! You see!
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What you say?
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY SPIRIT
SING!
With love.
What?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Sure.
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
What is it, Betty?
Right.
That man -- who is he?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
It's true -- I know her.
Were you wicked?
Enough jabber.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Wet behind the ears.
Amateurs 2
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
A novice.
She won't?  Why not?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Bless you.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
And all those like you.
What's a concubine?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
No problem.
And whom would you call?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
No.  No.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
A vote?
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
But...
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
So I don't shop.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
No nothing.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
How?
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
A hiding place.
What's the problem?
It didn't work, Vince.
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
She's praying.
But how do we get there?
But where?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
You must have missed your mark.
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
What of it?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
They need guidance.
Well... that might be... helpful.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Look again.
What kind of nuts?
Listen.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
You made this, and the drawings?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
I insist that you have it.
They have done nothing of the sort.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
But, why?  Tell me why.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
It was you there?
And, what did he say?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Yes.  Here...
In a way, yes.
Sit.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
She did not do it... please listen...
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
That boy wants me to.
How are you, Bill?
He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Well, I guess it's all good.
They was a boy. We made friends.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Please Doyle, don't.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
I know Albert. We're friends.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I thought I told you to keep out!
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
What numbers do you punch?
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Why'd you live there?
They let you out?
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
You told me to come by.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
It was still alive when you buried it?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
It was fun, anyhow.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Huh?
I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
I reckon not.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
I've heard it said that way.
Can I help you, sir?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
An invitation?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
American literature. What else?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Huh?
What about for you?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
He's crazy.
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Anything good?
You got it.
I'm all ears.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Yeah, probably.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
You don't give up, do you?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Yeah, like what?
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
What difference does it make?
I thought maybe he was pretending.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
And you told your nephew about it?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
What's your offer?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
You don't really want to know.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Is it yours?
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
None.
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
You're implying th...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Carl Heine came.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You're right.  I better use two.
Yes, he was.
Maybe...?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Apparently.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
Carl never lied.
I can't speak for him.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Bye.
It's private.  Go away.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
With me?
Right.  We have the same blood type...
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
You better come help me.
Then pull the emergency brake!
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What happened?
Jerry - there's another problem.
Like what?
What do you think you're doing?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
We're not on the pier yet -
If there's anything I can do for you -
No.  It's nice and cozy.
No, no.
I'm just going to get some ice.
You betcha.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
This is where I get off.
Sorry.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We'll adopt some.
Thank you.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Then why did you take this job?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
What's in Florida?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
I want mine to wear glasses.
Why not?
Not at all.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
My fault.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your view of what?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- riding to hounds -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Why?
Shell Oil?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
What is it?
I don't mind if I do.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
What's on Thursdays?
Completely.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
Bacardi 151.
But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
Hey.
What for?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Crikey.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
I have to.  I’m the best man.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Sometime, but not like this.
That's where we came from first.
Colored.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
But where is my daddy!?
Nothin'...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Can you swim?
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
NO! N-O, NO!
No buts, Rita!
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
I think so...
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
They gone to the field...
Yes, David...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Yes, ma'am...?
Act like one!
Goodnight.
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
You ready to eat?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Behold my glory.
Montana.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Kenny! I saw Kenny again!
Whoops.
No you can't Kenny!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Something big, children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
That's gonna take a long time!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Yeah!
YOU BASTARD!!
You bastards!!
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Yeah, they suck.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Right away, ma'am!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Alright, I'll make the call...
Oh yeah!
Don't believe the hype!!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
No! It can't be!
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Hi Stan.
Cool!
Check.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
So...
Oh he did, did he?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Uh...
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Just don't move around too much.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Is there anything I can help you with?
So I've been told.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
What are you going to do about it?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
One moment please...  one moment please...
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
He's my dad.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
Need some advice, huh.
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
It looks like dwarf bowling.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
I couldn't care less.
What about bowling?
You're a scumbag.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Who's there?
SHEILA!
You made me hurt him!
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
He's no father to you.
I'm not here to - I can't...
Business.
Can I ask you something personal?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Plan B is your dad.
He said he'd sponsor me.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Did you - kill him?
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I'm not here to bowl.
Tell your little pal to let go.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Back away then.
I said back away.
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
How about I just press the button?
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- Wait a second --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
But sir --
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
They're coming.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Please watch your closest monitor...
She's not gonna know, sir.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
What do you make of this?
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Wait -- down where?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
What could have done this?
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
I fixed your suit.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
You think, in the sphere --
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
It's a soporific.
It's like a sleeping pill?
That's when you went in the sphere.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
You'd have to ask them.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
You're staring at me.
No, why don't --
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What are they?
Did I?
What happened to her?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
I thought she was with you.
You didn't say that about the food?
The three of us.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hold on.
Wait!
You mean forget?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
This way, sir.
What report?
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What?
You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
That's where my father was killed.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
You mean we should go after her!...
What's that?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
It could be worse...
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Why?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
Why didn't you say so before.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
They'll find its weakness.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
YAAAAAAAA !
Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
It looks like an... asteroid.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Zander, please... Let's go !
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
So who's got time to get married ?
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
I have good reflexes.
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
We've gotta go get her !
Thank you, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
What ?
What's that, Diz ?
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
The Rodger Young just burned up...
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Been better, buddy.
What is it, Rico ?
I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
May I ask Why?
Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Viewer, standard ahead.
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Viewer ahead, sir.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
What answers?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
You haven't heard of it.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
But why the dalmation?
Of course.
Surest thing you know.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Paperclip?
"Room Service!"
I don't drink.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
What?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well ain't you amazing.
I saw...
Morning.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I'm sorry.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What're you doing here...?
Hi.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
They think it's your First Wife...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
I'm having dinner with W...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
If there's anything I...
I think he's moved...
I, uh...  Um...
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
Why?
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Is...Is the Movie!
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I'll put the, in your r...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I can't tell.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Well.
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Why?
Main Street.
Doug, the traffic light...
Doug...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Later for you, pal.
A witness to what...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
I know you do.
So be it.
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I...
I don't...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Find the money.
Pay her off.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Sherry, Sherry...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It happens.
That will never happen.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
Oh, yeh.
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
And this is my room so get out!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
That doesn't bother me.
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
No!
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Is that like Luigi's?
Mom...?
Before you.
Rache can do that part.
But you can still see him.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You're WHERE?
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
And we all went through that together?
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We don't have any coffee.
What did you do?
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
Thanks, but it's under control.
It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
No.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
Feeling the pressure?
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Aw.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You'll learn.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Jesus.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I think so too...
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Don't ever say that.
What if he is?
Like what?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
But still, you can't be sure.
I am sure.
No, you don't.
You started filling out your college applications yet?
Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Huh?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Your story was terrible!
Just the same.
Yeah?
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
OK!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
That's good.
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
...gger.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Anything I might know about?
I do.
How many?
I know.
Is it loaded?
What for?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
You're going to pay for this...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
Shut up!
The transmission is an hour old...
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Get your men to do it!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
There's enough in one vial...
Did you get that, Kulnick?
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
What are you talking about, Major?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
What did you say?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Yes?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Do you think they would cheat?
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
How many planes did we lose?
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
War?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Ready, Major.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Some kind of signaling.
I've got one.
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Master Kong.
He's dead.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Hell, he looks dead.
Then get off my back!
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I get a red light.
Let me check.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Was it okay?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
No I quit.
A cloud?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
Shut up! Aw...
Sorry.
That sounds so depressing.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
So, how was the ride, kids?
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Well, play it, man.
Yeah!
Yes!
Come on. Inside.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Yes.
He is.
Mm-mm.
Really?
Deep down. Way down.
I'm not a nice guy.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
I hate that.
Hey!
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Yeah.
How?
Jeff. Jeff.
Mm-hm.
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
You do.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Don't do that, man, okay?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Jeff!
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You just became a statistic!
Cleo!
Wayne Gretzky.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Well, I want to know what happened --
We're here for you, Diane.
Kim-Lo?
Ammo?
Or, I could get my own horse...
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
More proof God's a guy...
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it.
It's from hunger.
Thank you.
How about the Rainbow Room?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Well....
Are you hungry?
You'll be waiting for me?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What has Artie to do with it.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's who?
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Nice job.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
If you please.
Twenty-two.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
What happened?
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Gordon Cole?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
I wrote that with my heart.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
What month?
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
You think this is all very funny.
What's that?
"Mad about the boy."
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
This is the right day.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
For me?  Okay.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Who didn't?
I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
No.
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Well thanks a pile, fella.
Well, just one.
And you think you're in love.
Nurse!
I could force you.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Nice to meet you.
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
I know.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
What? What did you tell me?
I seem to be.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
I didn't --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
Oh...I came close once.
No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
Call me.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Mmmmm . . .
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
What are you doing?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
I know, I'm the fault.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Yeah. A raise . .
Turn on the T.V.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
What she call you?
I didn't have my camera with me.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Tell me.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
What's wrong?
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Maybe I could try --
Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Does Lois know about this yet?
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
A parka.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It's beautiful.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
My kind of people.
I asked the right question.
To ski?
He has powers as we do . . .
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
Like me?
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
You're just an experiment, freako!
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Nobody else.
It was hot, yes.
North. It's north
Oh, for God's sake!
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
What are you doing here?
Okay.  Take me to your leader.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
We just take it?
What do you suggest, my dear?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You can't do this to me!
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
Twenty-four.
Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
You've got me? Who's got you???
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Can you really see through anything?
Uh-huh.
Very much.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
On radio waves?
And garbage doors.
We're...not together.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
She's resting.  In her room.
No.  It should be dry by now.
When the game's over, I guess.
Why?
Because I have to.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
With our hands.
What do you mean?
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Yes.
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Oh.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Why?
Will you be spending more than a night?
No.
How old is she?
Is this it?
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
News?
Yes.
I need money.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
I'm a lawyer.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
No.
Who did they get for that?
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
No.
No.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
You remember that much?
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Don't even try to remember.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
The Ottos.
Hitler!
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I guess you're right, but -
You told him that?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Can I come in for a minute?
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
When?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
What about?
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
We stick in each others craw.
Yes, but why?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I didn't do anything!
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No way!
What does that mean?
Max.
Pain causes it?
I'm sorry, John.
I have to go away, John.
No shit?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
I have detailed files.
Can you get us in there, past security?
Yes.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I'm Steve. What's your name?
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
What's that mean?
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Your mother, too.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
What is this, Emmi?
Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I don't buy that.
Tough, tough!
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Who?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Yes, I know who he is.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
I don't understand what you mean.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
That's what I asked.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
What?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
That's the way it was told to me.
I want it to be over for you.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
A girl.  You know.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Who is in authority here?
Projections were far too optimistic.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Did you?  Kudos.
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
It was an accident.
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
It was a gift... from my brother.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You're the one who started running.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Is this you?
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Wha... ?
Nicholas...
Who the fuck cares?
All I mean is... someone like you...
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Nicholas...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
It's mine...
Guess you missed it.
Stop talking to them!
Nicholas...
Stop it!
I didn't know what else to call you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
It's a profound life experience.
Call them.  Trust me.
Will you?
But, will you?
I know...
How do you mean, exactly?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What is?
A game?
That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Fine.
Not much, I think.
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Follow me.
Just what I told you.
Uh... Nell Vance...
And what kind of sleeper?
Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
So far.
No one will come any nearer than that.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Why?
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
Why?
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Oh, god.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Fuck you.
Lookin' good.
This ain't your lot?
I only asked.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
One thing I need.
That would be too easy.
Didn't get it.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Hey?
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
How far?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Eh?
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Good luck.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
Something's on.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
You must know Ian.
Ann. Will you come in?
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Oh, Mr Crane--
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Well? How'd she do?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
All right, I guess.
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Come on in.
So you paid the guy?
Big Dave--
I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
Who?
I didn't say a word.
How are you?
What happened to you?
Honey...
It was Big Dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
You don't got a headache?
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Uh-huh.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Yeah?
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
His eyes are open.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Behind you.
What's the combination?
Where's the head?
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
I think I should come with you.
Oh shit.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not giving up.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
How many storage areas are there?
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
He's right.  Follow me.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
Behind me.  Over there.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Gone.
The planetarium!
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
What's on the ClockCam?
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
What have we missed?
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--a dead one at that.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
You're the star.
--You never had a camera in my head.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Every time you and Marlon--
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Good night, Mother.
Oh, my God!
You hate gambling.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
That's not true.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Is there any way around?
Were you there--how do you know?
I don't understand.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Yes. I know.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Into what?
You got some kind of business with him?
Have you examined them?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Do you?
You can't.
-- You saw this experiment?
You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
Where are you, Mulder?
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I can't really talk right now.
And where are they going with it?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
General McAddie's.
I don't have his number.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Is she alive?
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
What happened?
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I don't need them anymore...
I know.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
I bet we can fix it.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
His own doctor?
I thought you wanted...
Holly.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
There's nothing in them.
Two weeks ago.
They'll be returned, miss.
You a friend of Lime's?
It wasn't petrol.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
This is where he vanished.
No.
You all did.
One can't just leave - please.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Why not?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Sure...
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Coffee.
Who?
Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
You remember me? Upstairs...
The Roumanian?
You don't mean that doctor?
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Not necessarily.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Traveler.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
We moved rooms because of him.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
You can swim?
Richard?
Eh - bonsoir.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
That's a movie, you moron.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
I just read it....
What's he care about?
You can't curse in front of it either.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I'm stealing it.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
It's the truth....
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
I agree.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
He has Israel.
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
Get the fuck away from me.
To hear them read Torah.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
Think about your father. Your sister.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
It will.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
JTS...?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Exactly.
No.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Eat shit....
Does he know?
... So am I.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Italian is practically the same thing.
Italy!
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
What else is there?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
It isn't lit yet.
I didn't say...  Brussels!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
What?
Well... about everything.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
I'm still here.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
... Are you sure?
No.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
I said, do you come here often!?
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
I'll be in my office.
A stereo type alarm system?
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
And when you drink, you get drunk.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
You really think so, Charlie?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
No. I'm serious about this.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Some crazy guy.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
That was a calamity!
Why?
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Get it out of here!
No —— not yet.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
I know. Funerals.
You. Us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
We will ——
That might depend on where you’re going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You know he’d have had him killed, don’t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
How... When did you...
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Something like that.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What do you suggest?
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I’m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he’s a good guy. He’ll listen to you. He won’t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Have we done business before?
What sort have you got?
What...?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
No... No...  I swear...
What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
Your secretary, huh!
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Carlos De Moraes?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Uh-huh. You could’ve waited for me inside.
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Maybe I don’t.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
What is?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Have you?
Shut up!
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
What’s that? A word?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Come with me...
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
So... what am I supposed to do now?
What... what do you mean?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
Tell me...
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
We have to press home the attack!
No...
I tried to.
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
I don't know...
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Yes, but...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
No no, I'm fine, really...
Who are you?
Trial?  What trial??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Not long ago...
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
That'll put fire in my soldiers!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...
No...!
And you didn't jump of your free will?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
If you kill him, you kill me!
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I -- I -- I...
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Because... I have to be alone!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
But you already confessed this morning...
I need to confess again.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
Then... why are you here so often?
What... does he... look like?
Why did she have to die?
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Really?
How are you doing?
Dead.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Here.
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Tough luck.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
What d'you mean, take the table away?
That's better than yesterday.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
If you need help...
I'm not going anywhere.
Stop it, Wladek.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Where do you live?
Show me.
No, it was a table.
There is something to be said for silence
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
I'll be back.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
He chopped it off
She never gives him a turn.
What will I play?
Play a song then
All right if I look around your lobby?
Naw, it's okay.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
No.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
We'll get by without 'em.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
No.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Pass.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
But what about all these other people?
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Maybe a couple million.
Get on with it then.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
He'll never do it.
I think he will.
Is that what it means?
Just a minute...
He's just around the corner.
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Then what are you hiding?
Did he tell you where he was going?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
I've got to see you alone!
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
And he still wants to marry me!
But it isn't bad weather now.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
No.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Well, what?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Just what I said I'd do.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
They'll want more than your word for that.
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
All right - you didn't.
Why tell me?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
By the way, how is your father's side?
Rye.
That's jolly.
Maybe it would if I took it.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Someone get a doctor.
Want a drink?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
It was his body that was buried there.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Why not?
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
We're going to keep driving.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Break it out.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
I heard!
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
I out rank you, that's why.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Roger that.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
They're not going to--
I heard it click.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
Just stay down.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
What?
Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
But...
Yeah.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Really?
He's going to slow down.
People are suffering.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
Now you need me.
I could.
Like I said; so?
What?
Yes!
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
You want to crawl, crawl.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
All last night he could have been--
You want to say some words?
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Too low.
Now?
But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
AH UGH.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
Where's LUH?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Look!
...and you're not lost now?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
You should know better than that!
Where are they?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Hang on.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
You don't have to talk about it.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Which one's which?
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
We've created a monster.
People are dying.
What? Nobody, I-
But sir--
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
It's our only option.
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
No.
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Smart. London, eh?
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
You can trust me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
The pepper, too?
Ah!
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
But, Lily--
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh! You didn't read it!
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Yes.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
Um-hum ...
Then riding together.
Precisely.
Like that!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 
Because I want to make it tough for you.
But I don't want to be a lady.
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Jacques!
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
May I?
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Then why did you do it?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
But you saw it here.
An hour, two at most.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
She knows.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Well I can.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Yes, exactly!
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
A mistake?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
He does landscapes.
This is crazy.
I know, I know.
I'll wait here.
Never let go.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Thanks.
I think you do.
Guess again, copper.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
You've got lipstick all over you.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
But--
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
Lonesome?
Who with?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
You can live that down, can't you?
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
Change?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Get it!
Oh, yes. On the pier.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
I'm sorry to hear that.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
What'll I say?
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
I thought I put you to bed.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Somebody's got to do it--
Well, let's hear the poem--
What's the matter, Mary?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
--And he has sex appeal.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
The country boy's about due.
Why don't you leave me alone?
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Not a chance--I'm through. 
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Thank you.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Isn't that a daisy?
You whore!  You filthy whore!
I don't understand.
Well I'm not so go home.
Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
This brand.
Better.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
So what does he want?
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
All right.  Then what?
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Yeah.  Or undertakers.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
You did.  Well... thank you.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
That a fact?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Yeah, and dangerous.
Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
Admiral, are you suggesting -
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
And still not a thing to watch.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
- We all want what we can't have?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Is this another one of your games?
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
I see...
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Depends what number you write.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Nice to run into you again.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
What do you mean?
Of course.
Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Who's Wade?
No.
You leave me no alternative.
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
You come with me -  You stay here.
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Thank you sir! Thank you!
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
What is it, noontime?
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
Not anymore, not in the city.
Gideon, don't say things like that.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
When did you talk to Harry?
Don't shout!
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Woody!  Buzz!
No, you can't.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Trouble?!  Where?!
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Woody!  The rocket!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I can't see a thing!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Look!  Janie!
Will you quit moving around?!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Excuse me.
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
You did what?
In my pocket.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
It was only a mouthful!
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl --
She asked me not to.
Oh, it is?
Not yet.
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Just watching you.
I don't know.
How long's the job?
You do?  What else you do?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
Yes, sir!
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
We keep our mouths shut.
This is a very different proposition.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
It could mean that, yes.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
What do you look for?
Any way we can do it better?
I don't know what to say.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
Shag her senseless.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
What?
And don't make any noise.
The point is, you've got to find something new.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No. Me Neither.
Clear?
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
The park?
Roald Dahl.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
It wasn't that bad.
What?
He made me lick it.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Four Grand.
That's hardly a substitute.
Your usual table, sir?
Six weeks.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
It could. Yes.
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
No, but you can bet they will.
It's all I have.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
I am here, Captain.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
What makes you think I won't turn us around?



"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Did he say why?
Okay, okay...
What -- ?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
I'm sorry -
If you think -
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Probably.
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
End of line.
I'm shocked.
Yeah.  You know Harry.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You seem fine now.
Yeah, right.
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
He could be working her to get to you.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Here they come.
No!  Never!
So, it was your first time.
I'd like that.
I agree.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Yeah, it was wild.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
What'd you do, honey?
Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
I can do it!
No.  Doris.
Sure, hon.
Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
Is it working yet?
Did you pork her Harry?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Harry... snap out of it!
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
You can trust me completely.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Find out who this Renquist it.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Nope.
You can't have just one.
This is great, we got cable.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Is that your real name? Really?
Sure. Why not?
I love to get pie after a movie.
What do you want to know?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
You bet. How much is that worth?
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
My pimp.
What?
Will you be my wife?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Thank you.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
I just gotta get somethin'.
Is this a joke?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Heard that.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
You'd really do that?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Good for you.
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What's to think about?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Really?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
No. No you're not.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
No.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Uh-huh.
McTeague.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Sure. No problem.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Exactly room-mates.
You're right. It is.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well, you go down Beechwood...
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
Shut up!
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
1995?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
I thought I was in...prison again.
I don't know -- I don't remember.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
You know -- your plan.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Think you'll live that long?
You afraid of the dark?
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Will be.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
I need a ticket.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You own this place?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Open up!
It is morning.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Yes.  Yes it is.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
Uh-huh
You didn't hear something?
What does it look like?
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess it must.
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
Have you ever been there before?
I can't.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Where are you going?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
Now what?
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
No.  I swear it.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Hungry?
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Talk?  About what?
I do.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
No.
The time wasn't right.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
Jake--
I came to kill her.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
Stand up.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
What happened?
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
That's 'cause he's dead.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I think I've heard that before.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Who the hell are you?
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
I was hoping we could talk.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
What makes you say that?
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
What are you talking about!
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
Harlin around?
He's up at the Look Out.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
Soda.  You know.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess it must.
You know what I want.
How do you know he's still not here?
No.
Did you ever?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
There is no us, remember?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Get in.
A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
What kind?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
Heineken?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
Yes.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
We're supposed to be honest.
I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
Seventy-five percent.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
In under six seconds.  I've heard.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
That's great.
You're secret identity.  That man was right.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
Is that right?
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
Okay.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
On a bench, across the street.
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
But... if he doesn't miss?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
He's... he's dead.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
Oh.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
I got him.
Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
I can't see 'em.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
You better get on back, Miss.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Eleven.
She gave me the evil eye.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
How far kin you see?
Yeah?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
Two more hogs got the fever.
Best we move that pig.
Tom?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
You gonna share your half with him?
Yeah.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
Well, suppose he does?
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
An' if I spot 'em?
No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Goddamnit.
They'll never stop.
Then who goes?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Did you hear what he just said?
County. I was in for fraud.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
What about Redfoot?
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
What?
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I know he was good.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
I'm not a rat.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
What did he find?
Very good.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.  It would be.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
You may step down.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I am seventy-four years old.
That's what I'd planned to...
I.  Yes.  It is.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Yes.
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
Then why don't you testify?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
Thank you for seeing me.
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Mr. Concannon...?
Mr. Alito, please.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
Maybe I can do something right.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
Where is he?
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... now who is that ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
...he's a good man...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
That's right.
The 'History'...?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked?
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Huh.  And why is that?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Me, too.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I married into it.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Almost a year.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Where'd she go?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
About three years.
I want to know who you are.
Just dinner.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Why?!
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Yes --
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
No! Let me go!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Oh... wandering about.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Wandering about.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
I enjoyed talking to you.
What?
No.
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
No.
No, thank you.
Madeleine!
What was it inside that told you to jump?
Vaguely...
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Yes?! But --
I love you too... too late... too late...
No... we're together...
Madeleine --
Let me go! Let me go!!
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Uh-huh!
Could be.
That!?!
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Around.
Wandering.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
But you said grey, sir.
What's that?
First of all...
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
I don't have to...
She's dead.
What did you say?
They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
Go home!
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Sure, why not.
I'm not wrecking the transmission!
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
That is absolutely not true.
Alright. Let's do it.
Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Who? What are you talking about?
I don't give a damn.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're driving me nuts!
They're singing.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
If anything ever happens to me...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
What is her disposition?
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
I'm talking about prayer.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
What?
What?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
What are you going to do?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
My what?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What?
They need leadership.
Goosed!
How about my Fatburger?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
What?
I do.
I think so.
Don't you dare.
What?
He's weird.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Not padded ones.
I need your help.
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Just a bit of organizing.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
No way.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Yeah. You.
Yes.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
What money?
What?
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Come on.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
What is it?
How do you know she's dead.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
"You Send Me."
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
I do.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Was that difficult to get?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Come down.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
And this innocent child.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Wasn't that cowardice?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must listen to me before you go.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Yes, sir.
That's fifteen by seven?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
Well... is it so urgent?
And let him get run over by somebody else?
He's lying through his ass!
You cannot leave ...
I had so many things to think about!
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Good, then let's go!
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Hello.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
From the terrace.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Do I get to see it or not?
It's nano—technology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
Should I have?
It was you, wasn't it?
My God...
All my work is my finest.
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
A little less than yesterday.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it —— I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
I know who would know.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
Authority still makes me nervous.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
Thanks.
Sid?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his Re—Election Rally...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
For Schumann.
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Izzat the thing...
And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you <u>mean</u> "and..."?
What rig?
...the Harvester... 
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll see you at National.
...you want us to go to War...
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
...take a long view.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Knock on wood.
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
...what are we going to do...?
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
..."down safely," crew perished in the Crash....
Ask it.
I'll play your silly game.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...Good...
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
...uh ... No, that's...
"The Country Is At War." 
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
Yeah...?
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
Is he dead?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
They look stupid.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
...as of today, 89% favorable.

SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Oh really.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
The FAA announcement.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Okay.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
I don't understand.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.
You really do believe in destiny?
Only if I want something bad enough.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
...how do you know? You wish...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Yeah, yeah, OK
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Have a nice day  sir
Vell.  Goodnight.
Oh that explains everything.
Who's is all this?
Six six and six
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
They're all human beings
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
A ghost?
Because he was worried about me.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
You're joking.
How do you know it's a she?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Oh-kay...
I have to go.
Um...yes.
I'm not...
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
That's not...It's not like that.
Wait!  Don't go...
Thank you.
What?
No, I don't.
Claire.
It's fine.
Do we have to?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
...no...no...no...
In the window.  Norman's at work.
M-E...
It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I think so
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
I don't know.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Don't.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's Saturday.
I am, really.
After that.
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Why?
Claire...
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Did you tell her?
No.  Look!  In the window.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
But then you've been so much better...
Then where is she?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
We walked all night...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Your wife...
That's not what I'm sayi--
We don't know that for sure.
Look for antiques...
Do you know it?
Mauduh...
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I want to see my mother.
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
Who is this...?
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
There are things I have to know!
It wes a dream...!
You - are - a - murderer.
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I love Michael...
That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
You bastard!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
Sure...
Yes, one and a half please.
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
What did you do with her?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
Well, Dad said...
Cut it out, before you break something!
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
We love our lives just the way they are.
Of course we are.
I guess.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
I will not have my boys arguing.
You mean they knew who I was?
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
It's not up to me.
Just a formality.
You're a peach.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Me-ow.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I guess.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
A little respect would be nice, that's all.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
And then what?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
That's refreshingly deviant.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Maybe someday.
That's hard to believe.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
But how would we pay our bills?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
I was like a different person tonight.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
You think we should be more open minded?
He was in a league of his own.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Maybe she used another name.
Back to the land of grownups.
Unless what?
I net a guy in a bar.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
Yes.
I guess.
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
You didn't cuff her?
What?
Nothing.
I think we just need to get wasted.
I'm not on your property!
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
About six and a half million dollars.
Okay.  I love you too.
You think that's wise?
Forget it.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
You can't...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Story's the same, Detective...
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
That's right.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
No.
Shit. Here we go again.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Aha?
Is this leading somewhere?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Yes.  Now, observe....
I'm going to hit you.
That's right... That's good.
Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
My pleasure.
I know!  I know!
Thank you.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
My... the wild west.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
That'll be all, boys.
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
I deal with some tough customers.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Then come with us.
Yes...?
You are very important, Willow.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Not today, Willow.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Let me see it.
You're not a woman.
I don't believe you.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
Friend of yours?
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
Willow!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Burn it to a fine ash.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
The limitless power of...
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
His will.
There's nobody here.
Somebody has to do it.
I changed her already!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Who??
Cows. You know, cows?
I've seen pictures.
Not one this big.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
I thought I was the English.
It's been a while.
No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Okay, Mr. Book.
What's that, Sam?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
I would not be too sure.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Oh. The bullets.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Wrong.
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I will be the judge of that.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
Oh ....
Not so fast!  Not....
This?
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Aw, come, come, come --
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Her -- her name is Emily.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I'd sooner wait outside.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Where's Kansas?
I don't blame you for that.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
What?
Here -- here --
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
What was that?
Now...
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
I want to see you and your wife right away....
To Oz?
Hurry -- hurry --
I don't think I could, but we could try.
Yes.
It makes you nervous?
You promised us real things -- a real...
But I still want one.
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
So who are you?
It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Yes.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
We’re alright.
I know.
I have to go.
No. You’ll be safe here.
Really?
You, of course. I need some information.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
A rope!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
We don't know that.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Veidt¹s complex.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Everything's changed --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
I don't think she's coming with us.
What does this mean?  What does it --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
What is that ungodly smell?
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
What do I get out of it?
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
That's exactly why we need them.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
I'm from L.A.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
You're joking, right?
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What are you talking about?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
If necessary.
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
To find Rogue.
Enough for a test.
What do you want with him?
I know.
What was your grandfather's name?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
MMMmmmm.
Yes.
Whatever makes you happy.
Darling!
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
What?
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
And do you also say Fro dereck?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
I want that brain.
All right... elevate me!
You've got it, master.
What?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
Inga, wake up!
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
Good night!
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
His schwanzstucker.
Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
Do Something!  Stall them!
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
